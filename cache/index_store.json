This consolidated rulebook pertains to the 4th Cycle: Maelstrom version of Alamaze. If you \r\nare participating in a 3rd Cycle: The Choosing game, please refer to that manual. Alamaze is a turn-based strategy game that features more than 100 distinct commands \r\ncovering the aspects  of  ruling  a  kingdom  in  a  fantasy  realm. There  are  commands  for \r\nmilitary  engagements between  kingdoms, wizards  to  cast  a  myriad  of magical  spells, \r\npolitical  figures  to assume control of another’s region, an  array  of magical  artifacts to \r\nassist  efforts,  and  a  streamlined  economic  system to  manage  the necessary  details  of \r\nruling a kingdom. With  the  advent  of the 4th Cycle: Maelstrom in  2019, then further enhanced  in  2022, \r\nAlamaze now consists of 32 fantasy kingdoms, 130 magical spells, 102 military units, 67 \r\nartifact encounters, and a rare resource called Mithril. The map consists of 13 different \r\nregions, each providing special considerations for your kingdom during gameplay.

Since Alamaze is a strategy fantasy game, the ultimate objective \r\nis to conquer enough of regions on the map to win the game. A typical game lasts 20-30 \r\nturns, though the maximum is 40 turns. Kingdoms gain control of regions by conquering \r\ntheir population centers (cities, towns, villages). Population centers  may  be  acquired  either  by  military  means (groups  with  troops that \r\nattack or lay siege to the popcenter), or by political means (moving an emissary like a \r\nDuke or Baron to the popcenter to usurp control). Defeat other kingdoms by conquering all of their population centers until they have none \r\nremaining and/or  capturing all  of their  political  emissaries. Most  of  the  time though, \r\nkingdoms  will  be overcome prior  to  that by  wiping  out  their  military  forces on  the \r\nbattlefield. Victory. When a kingdom has control of enough regions to win the game (five to win as \r\nRex), the player just needs to issue a Rex Victory command (Order #996) for the game \r\nto end in their favor. In some games where there is stiff competition among the players, no kingdom will be \r\nable to satisfy the Rex Victory condition by the game’s end (40 turns). In such scenarios, \r\nthe kingdom with the most status points at the end will be declared as the winner by Lion’s \r\nShare Victory. When a game ends, the game’s statistics will be recorded on our server and available to \r\nview at the Valhalla website (listed in the Introduction above). Dismissal. Players  who  have  missed  issuing  commands for  their  kingdom for three \r\nconsecutive  turns will  be  automatically  dismissed from  the  game. Their  kingdom  will \r\nremain on “standby mode” for three additional turns before the kingdom is completely \r\neliminated from play. Sequence of Events. All actions are executed in their numerical ordered sequence. Before \r\na turn is processed, commands from every kingdom are organized by their order number, \r\nand actions with the same order number are randomly shuffled.

Special \r\nthanks to Strylian for making these videos. Quick Start Guide (Sample Turn 1 Actions) \r\n \r\nSome suggestions to consider for your first turn are: \r\n \r\n1. Have your king (or queen) Enamor Regional Reactions (Order #470) in the region \r\nwhere  your  capital  is  located. This  is  perhaps,  the  most  significant  action  that a \r\nplayer needs to do in order to be successful politically in the region.

Defense. Population centers have two defensive values, representing their strength in the \r\nevent  of  attack  or  siege. The base  defense is  how  the population  center defends, \r\nregardless of which kingdom controls it. The adjusted defense modifies the base defense \r\ndepending upon a number of factors. There is also a random factor of a positive or negative \r\n15% being applied to the defense before battle. A group attacking a population center \r\ngenerally should have twice the combat value vs. the population center’s defense. This \r\nis  in  part  due  to  the strong missile  values that population  centers have defending \r\nthemselves, and the fact that population centers do not retreat. Loss Divider. All population centers (as well as opposing troops) have a loss divider value \r\nfor combat. This factor adds an extra level of protection in addition to the defense rating. The average loss divider for a population center is 1.5. There is also a random factor that \r\nadjusts  the  loss  divider  higher/lower before a  given  battle  to  represent  the  will  and \r\ndetermination of the fighting force. In combat terms, the loss divider represents how much \r\ndamage will be reduced by the attacking force during combat. For example, if a town has \r\na loss divider of 2.0 and the attacking force has a 50,000 missile rating, that amount is \r\ndivided by the town’s 2.0 loss divider and becomes 25,000 damage that is inflicted during \r\nthe missile stages  of  combat. Fortifications (listed  below)  will  toughen  not  only  the \r\ngeneral defense rating of the population center, but also its loss divider value that reduces \r\ndamage received during battles. The loss divider value has no relevance during a siege \r\noperation and only the population center’s defense value is considered during a siege. Control. Population centers are either controlled or neutral. As a game begins, over half \r\nof all population centers are uncontrolled. Players may gain or lose control of population \r\ncenters  by  either  military  or  political  means. Neutral  population  centers  are  easier  to \r\nacquire through political means than a controlled one.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"135d3d3e-e86b-4355-af57-2997f0c17965":{"id_":"135d3d3e-e86b-4355-af57-2997f0c17965","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"byoL6OKzF7pLVfuIn2yrWS8/9GlBKPxu2CBHXjPO+s8=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"XmIq1G2AAs8MrB85AN4A0RpanNcLtb5HcFZeA7bJ7B8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b0b2ff1e-d6a1-482e-8efd-ec4d7903948a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"I2tmmwaio7wUHL4h8tbHddPkHMY7rhrfdBQE8xHO95E="}},"hash":"00sFLhcKA0P/T6ybfQCgyRvlKx64jnLk+aU1z5QRMkw=","text":"Military control is determined by \r\nthe strength of the military group vs. the defense of the population center.

Kingdom groups in this region gain a slight morale edge (+2 points). A \r\nkingdom, which is the enemy of the kingdom controlling the region, cannot become \r\nFriendly while the enemy controls the region. • Tolerant – The citizens  here  regard  the  kingdom  with  an  open  mind,  if  not  an \r\noutstretched hand. More challenging to be successful than having Friendly status. • Suspicious – Some acts in the past have damaged the goodwill of the people of \r\nthis region to the kingdom.

Control. The control of regions is critical to victory and winning the game. When a kingdom \r\ngains control of a region, several significant benefits accrue: \r\n \r\n• Any population centers which are neutral at the time when control of the region is \r\nestablished will raise the banner of the conquering kingdom, thereby adding their \r\nfood/gold resources  to  those  available  to  that  monarch  (and  terminating  their \r\nneutrality). • The regional reaction level of the region to the controlling king is improved by one \r\nlevel, but cannot be better than Friendly. This means the king's emissaries will find \r\ntheir missions in that region easier to accomplish. Should the region subsequently \r\nbe lost, the regional reaction will likewise be reduced by one level (e.g., Friendly \r\nchanges to Tolerant if the region is lost). • Controlled regions count towards the victory requirements for that kingdom. • If  the  player  has  a  Provincial  Governor  stationed  somewhere  in  the  region  when \r\ncontrol is established, the Governor will increase his rank to Baron (one Governor \r\nonly). If  there are no  Provincial  Governors but  an  Ambassador exists,  then the \r\nAmbassador will advance to the rank of Provincial Governor. Either advancement is \r\nautomatic and at no cost to the controlling king. • Regional  Support. All popcenters in  a  region  controlled  by  the  regional  controller \r\nhave 10% added to their defense due to logistical support within the region as well \r\nas rural militia joining the defense.

This influence is NOT to be confused with regional influence, which \r\nis the percentage of controlling all of the popcenters in a given region. A Ruler’s political influence level will rise and fall during the course of the game. The \r\nRuler's political  influence ranges from  a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 25. However, \r\nraising influence above 20 to reach the maximum of 25 is only possible through special \r\nmeans. Such  as, conquering  a  region  that  adds  a  point  each  time,  being  on  the  High \r\nCouncil and voting to increase one’s influence level, or by a wizard casting certain spells. The Ruler’s influence level determines the maximum number of commands that the player \r\nis able to issue every turn, which is the influence (rounded down) +2. For example, if a \r\nRuler’s influence is 15, the player may issue up to 17 orders on the next turn. The Ruler may undertake certain activities which will increase (or lower) the influence, \r\nand some campaign results will also affect the influence level. For example, when a King \r\ngains control of a region, or assumes a position in the High Council, his influence increases \r\nby one level. Likewise, if he loses a region or his seat on the High Council, his influence \r\ndecreases by one. If a kingdom's capital is lost, the King will suffer a loss of one level of \r\ninfluence. The  influence  level  is  of  major  significance  in  determining  the  success  of  a kingdom’s \r\nemissary activities because the emissary's power, and so his chance of success, is based \r\non the kingdom’s influence.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"cd481824-d0cf-4c56-86d6-49f0debad670":{"id_":"cd481824-d0cf-4c56-86d6-49f0debad670","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"K7EEkZC23KhdEQZ5LaV6zkS/u1JfdjQlVgz15btBkC4=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"A2Epnnjoiupk5aJx+mhb8tKGeFwboqgQsMYJ6soNLiI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f43618ee-5ba0-4ec2-9dd0-66efb867a103","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"Zc9pGzm/QXwKq1G971Ptf0FejBIj/F3sJOVkHTGN5r0="}},"hash":"/BSnCNt3tHid0vzDv42hfMF0/9JK99L2Fc6+9bIPIrw=","text":"The kingdom’s influence will never be less than 8.

If the population center \r\nwas instead a town, he may not be arrested, but would in all likelihood, fail in his efforts. On the other hand, if the regional reaction was Friendly, or if the emissary was of higher \r\nranking, the attempt may be successful. Political  emissaries  who  are  incarcerated  are  prisoners  and  are  unavailable  to  receive \r\nfurther  orders  until  they  are  rescued  or  ransomed  back.

Sage Advice \r\n \r\nRebelling a population center is important before attempting an usurp for success. If a \r\nhigh-ranking  emissary  is  used  and your influence  is great enough, you  may  want  to \r\nconsider using a single emissary to usurp a popcenter without rebelling it. Check the player \r\naid tool of estimating your chances of success with a single emissary. To boost your chances of rebelling or usurping a popcenter, consider Stir Unrest (Order \r\n#315) with another emissary to aid the effort. Wizards casting Conceal Emissary (Spell #349) will make your emissaries invisible and \r\nundetectable  when  you  move  them  into  enemy  popcenters. Always  nice  to  have  an \r\nunsuspecting and surprise attack against a foe. To prevent other kingdoms from gaining control of your popcenters, consider casting Sleep \r\n(Spell #205), which incapacitates them for the turn. To protect your emissaries from being \r\nslept or kidnapped, cast Ward (Spell #301). Consider issuing Execute Hostages (Order #430) to eliminate prisoners if you are worried \r\nthat they may escape back to their original kingdoms. Or, set an agent on guard prisoner \r\nduty to prevent their escape. An important order for a player to consider is Sanctuary (Order #455). A sanctuary is a \r\nspecial location on the map for the royals to escape if the kingdom’s last population center \r\nis conquered by enemy forces (prevents your kingdom from being eliminated in the game).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"03bb4807-f7af-4cc2-85f9-917aba5ce942":{"id_":"03bb4807-f7af-4cc2-85f9-917aba5ce942","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"q/+m3QcJIbd3XVh4oAwU/nyGs4vS/9AyiCHic3eXpgk=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"/IfusCiAANiGl5YFZb65ND5mhz5BU8NlzY2zfwuRAK4="}},"hash":"cwDSF5kAg7VC8uem/Az1imUJ83848qJI9ZGdMdzpvJE=","text":"61 \r\nAgents \r\n \r\nCommands \r\nOrder #  53 – Guard (Emissary, High Priestess, Agent) \r\nOrder #  54 – Counter-Espionage (everything else) \r\nSpell  #211 – Dire Wolf Familiar \r\nOrder #299 – Guard Prisoners \r\nOrder #500 – Train Agent \r\nOrder #615 – Poison Food \r\nOrder #691 – Trail Group (pre-movement) \r\nOrder #692 – Learn Group Morale/Attrition \r\nSpell  #887 – Eagle Familiar \r\nSpell  #888 – Raven Familiar \r\nOrder #900 – Bribe Emissary \r\nOrder #910 – Transfer Artifact \r\nOrder #930 – Sabotage Popcenter \r\nSpell  #933 – Imp Familiar (Level 7 Assassin For Emissary) \r\nOrder #935 – Sabotage Seapower \r\nOrder #940 – Assassinate Figure \r\nSpell  #941 – Summon Demon (Level 14 Assassin For Emissary) \r\nSpell  #942 – Summon High Demon (Level 12 Assassin For Emissary/Leader/Wizard) \r\nOrder #945 – Assassinate Leader/Wizard \r\nOrder #950 – Rescue Hostage \r\nOrder #955 – Kidnap Figure \r\nOrder #960 – Steal Artifact \r\nOrder #965 – Steal Food-Gold-Mithril \r\nOrder #970 – Recon Area \r\nOrder #971 – Trail Group (post-movement) \r\nOrder #975 – Recon Seapower \r\nOrder #976 – Search For Popcenters \r\nOrder #977 – Search For Groups \r\nOrder #978 – Search For Encounters \r\nOrder #979 – Advanced Search (Popcenters, Groups, Encounters) \r\n \r\nAgents and fanatics share the same types of missions.

Agents and fanatics are able to perform defensive countermeasures to \r\nprotect a kingdom’s assets from being subject to enemy agents.

To protect figures, have a High Priestess cast Bless (Order #302), which is a more powerful \r\nversion than a wizard’s Ward (Spell #301). To improve food and gold production, have a High Priestess cast Summon Lesser Angel \r\n(Order #775), which increases production especially if done multiple times. The  best  manner  of  locating  invisible and teleporting groups by  high-level  wizards of \r\nopposing kingdoms is to have a High Priestess cast Divine Military Groups (Order #857) \r\nevery turn.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"7dcb9744-5acd-4234-bd0b-e7cefdf607e4":{"id_":"7dcb9744-5acd-4234-bd0b-e7cefdf607e4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"7ioTkn7hVQGpixdrOJUQRc8Sj7/R4Mm1GsK8+WGcotU=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"XvKcKX3Quo4AD36uhUcBJCDkfPM6+l9jqgtVOr7Weyk="}},"hash":"t1wfZswVZorJ2FwA3MHOCZtAXElXwLthfV6HuCJKuPI=","text":"70 \r\nGroups \r\n \r\nCommands \r\nSpell  #  88 – Instant Summon Phantasmal Forces \r\nSpell  #  93 – Instant Summon Phantoms \r\nOrder #194 – Wintering Group \r\nOrder #225 – Do Not Feed \r\nOrder #230 – Do Not Pay \r\nOrder #235 – Reorganize Troops \r\nOrder #238 – Morale Bonus \r\nOrder #511 – Hire New Figure (Leader, Wizard) \r\nOrder #550 – Train Troops \r\nOrder #560 – Recruit Troops (Popcenter) \r\nOrder #565 – Recruit Troops (Companion) \r\nOrder #605 – Equip Forged Item \r\nOrder #699 – Transfer Inactive (pre-movement) \r\nOrder #700 – Transfer Troops \r\nOrder #701 – Transfer Figures \r\nOrder #702 – Transfer Inactive (pre-movement) \r\nOrder #710 – Sea Movement \r\nOrder #715 – Sea Movement (PC Search) \r\nSpell  #718 – Speed \r\nOrder #720 – Land Movement \r\nOrder #725 – Land Movement (PC Search) \r\nOrder #730 – Set Ambush \r\nOrder #731 – Pursue Group \r\nOrder #732 – Intercept Group \r\nOrder #735 – Pursue Group (post-intercept) \r\nOrder #740 – Combine Groups \r\nOrder #741 – Transfer Troops (post-movement) \r\nOrder #742 – Transfer Figures (post-movement) \r\nOrder #743 – Transfer Inactive (post-movement) \r\nOrder #744 – Combine Groups \r\nOrder #745 – Rest Troops \r\nSpell  #778 – Protection Vs.

Typically, when one of your groups encounters another group, the exact number of \r\nbrigades comprising the foreign group will not be revealed. This represents the fog of war \r\nand takes into consideration the commander's desire not to reveal his hand to a potential \r\nenemy. Instead, a group's scouts will report the group to be one of the following: \r\n \r\n• Inactive. An inactive group has no troops, leaders, or wizards. Inactive groups may \r\nbe activated  in  the same area  of  another group. This  is  achieved  by  transferring \r\nbrigades of troops, leaders, and/or wizards to the inactive group. Groups become \r\ninactive  when  all  assets  they  possess  are  transferred to  another  group, or if the \r\ngroup is completely destroyed in combat. Inactive groups are always located at the \r\ncapital, and may become the recipient of troop reinforcements. • Patrol. This is a scout party consisting of at least one leader or wizard and perhaps \r\na dozen warriors. Patrols cannot attack or be attacked by other groups. Patrols may \r\nmove,  combine  with  other  groups,  recruit  troops,  perform  reconnaissance,  etc., \r\nhowever, patrols are unable to block the movement of non-allied emissaries moving \r\ninto a popcenter. • Brigade.

However,  an  undead  leader as  a nazgul is  immune  from  dying  in  such  cases. Evil \r\nkingdoms have access to convert their leaders into becoming undead with Transform To \r\nNazgul (Spell #877). Opposing wizards casting the Kill Leader/Wizard (Spell #96) may kill \r\nan undead figure. Agents with a weapon-classed artifact (e.g., Sword of Alvinitar) are able \r\nto assassinate undead figures. Morale. Each group has a morale level. Morale reflects the spirit of the troops, which is \r\naffected by their experience and the quality of their provisions (a group that is not fed will \r\nsuffer a 10% loss of morale, and a group that is not paid will suffer a 6% loss of morale). Morale  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  to  the  total  combat  value  of  the  group. A  group \r\nending  its  turn  in  a  Hostile  region  will  suffer  a  3%  morale  loss.

Group morale needs to be at or above 100% in \r\norder for the group to be able to force march on the map (allows up to 25 movement \r\npoints rather than the standard 20 points). Maximum morale is 160. Attrition. Attrition represents a loss or weakened state of a brigade of troops. Each brigade \r\nhas  its  own  attrition  value. When combat losses  are  suffered in  battle which  are  not \r\nsufficient to completely eliminate the brigade, its attrition value is changed to reflect the \r\ncasualties.

The loss divider value ranges widely depending upon the strength and \r\ncomposition of the particular troop type (e.g., dragons and armored knights have higher \r\ndefense ratings than troglodytes and skeletons). There is also a random factor that adjusts \r\nthe loss divider higher/lower before a given battle to represent the will and determination \r\nof the fighting force. In combat terms, the loss divider represents how much damage will \r\nbe reduced by the attacking force during combat. For example, if a brigade of knights has \r\na loss divider of 2.0 and the attacking force has a 50,000 missile rating, that amount is \r\ndivided by the brigade’s 2.0 loss divider and becomes 25,000 damage that is inflicted \r\nduring the missile stages of combat.

Patrols may force march without penalty (have 25 movement points rather than 20) so \r\nuse them to explore the map, especially in the early going. Patrols may also travel across \r\nthe sea without a sea-patrol interdicting them. A valuable tactic to consider is to move a patrol-sized group to an opposing population \r\ncenter  and  on  the  following  turn,  have a wizard  cast  Instant  Summon  Phantasmal \r\nForces/Phantoms (Spells #88, 93) to be able to attack the popcenter. Or, to cast spells \r\nlike  Meteor  Strike  (Spell  #155), which  requires a  brigade  of  troops  before  casting  the \r\nspell. Since the phantasmal forces/phantom troops are only temporary, no need to worry \r\nabout paying the maintenance cost every turn thereafter.

Sea patrol will not be \r\naddressed in this section of the rules, which deals only with group related combat. Combat \r\ncan be either group vs. group, or group vs. population center. Population centers never attack, they may only defend against attack. Each population \r\ncenter  has  a  defensive  value  associated  with  it. This  defensive  value  represents  a \r\ncombination  of  fortifications  and  the  defending  garrison.

Combat involving  population  centers  are  handled \r\ndifferently than group vs. group contests. Popcenter battles primarily consist of a missile, \r\nmagic, and multiple storm phases. The latter represents multiple waves of attacks upon \r\nthe popcenter (e.g., “storming” a castle). An important difference in population center battles is that the popcenter never retreats \r\nin battle. Only the attacking group is checked if it reaches its retreat threshold. To conquer \r\na population center, the attacking group needs to remain on the battlefield until it defeats \r\nthe entire popcenter’s combat value. Population centers have higher missile ratings that inflict significant damage early in the \r\nbattle. Attacking forces need to be strong enough to absorb the initial volley to continue \r\nin the contest. Also, kingdom capitals fight at elevated levels compared to other population \r\ncenters.

A  common  mistake  by  players  is  that  a  group  with  troops  at  the  same  location  as  a \r\npopulation   center is   considered to   be its   defender   and must   be defeated \r\n(destroyed/retreat) before  the  attacker  may  engage  with  the  popcenter. If you don’t \r\nattack the group and cause it to retreat, you won’t be able to attack the popcenter. In popcenter battles, the initial missile phase is quite devastating to attacking forces, so \r\nconsider having a wizard cast Wind Storm (Spell #89) to dampen that damage.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"0811b255-10a6-4c7a-8622-fbf52e00513b":{"id_":"0811b255-10a6-4c7a-8622-fbf52e00513b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5qzRXGhpPqbKWtlbPluakWKBSJcqmMZnac2Z/hI+ZyU=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"nILCW3hGN0woG/h1Gq3X9sKUnH5Ct9TVU3BWz5rwp08="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c2c2b8ec-570f-4d26-8a3b-bb74ca39777c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"jNdmvAaDjDFQEhIzFVypgRE6wlNxeVJ8/MjwbHRSNNY="}},"hash":"OTpbTinNm3IxO3BlE6BHTmrwWk6hX0cgKvWBVPWh0aE=","text":"Against  opposing  groups  with  strong  charge  values (e.g., Sacred  Order’s mounted \r\nknights), consider having a wizard cast Flash Flood (Spell #90) to reduce that damage.

Trades involving large amounts of a commodity (15,000+ units) will be disclosed on the \r\nkingdom turn report for all players to be aware of the transaction (e.g., \"The Elves traded \r\nunknown amounts of gold to the Sorcerer for a large supply of food\"). This is to alert other \r\nkingdoms of a possible collaboration between two unsuspecting kingdoms in the game. The only trade allowed between declared enemies (either kingdom \r\nhas declared the other an enemy) is payment of ransom  for the \r\nreturn of a hostage. Declared enemies may not trade gold for food, \r\nmithril, artifacts, or high council seats. The maximum trade amount of any commodity between kingdoms \r\nis 100,000 per turn.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"95bc7f90-31c1-48c4-845e-286da7ac754c":{"id_":"95bc7f90-31c1-48c4-845e-286da7ac754c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"svcpLU9M5ZxKn2Aa+OZCJUZiLeUwa/9hc8HoEiiCGGk=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"V6KWHkDRt6m+KMAuXCYdjD45mM7+x3EqizdSxp0QIuE="}},"hash":"TxSnQr1r3SlrVWUQ1J+8Af7tbMbdTBuNzkIe6SFlBNE=","text":"104 \r\n \r\nThe minimum amount of gold for trading artifacts is 10,000 gold.

The results of this exposure have varied in degree \r\nfrom  passing  embarrassment  to  decapitation. This  element  is  presented  in  Alamaze  as \r\nSkeletons in the Closet. Most kingdoms have three Skeletons in the Closet assigned to them at the beginning of \r\nthe game, but some kingdoms with the Devout trait have only two. A few kingdoms such \r\nas the Ancient Ones and Demon Princes have the advantage of not having any skeletons. Each  skeleton  represents  some  act  or behavior,  which  if  made  known  to  the  public  at \r\nlarge, would result in a decline of the King’s influence (-2 for a major skeleton, -1 for a \r\nminor skeleton). Major skeletons may also lower regional reactions in several regions. Skeletons are attained by bribing an inactive (no action taken that turn) political emissary \r\nof  the  given  kingdom. Any  activity  by  the  targeted  emissary,  will  prevent  a  successful \r\nbribe, which needs to be done secretly between the two parties. There is a percentage \r\nchance of a political emissary knowing a skeleton based upon the emissary’s power rating \r\n(e.g., a Baron has 50% chance of knowing a Skeleton In The Closet). Sage Advice \r\n \r\nAs mentioned above, you can bribe an inactive emissary for a skeleton, but an even easier \r\nway is to collect a skeleton from a prisoner. Only political emissaries are knowledgeable of skeletons, so don’t try to bribe an agent or \r\nhigh priestess, or the task will fail. If the targeted emissary to bribe has a Conceal Emissary (Spell #349) active for them, \r\nthe agent conducting the bribe has  to be at least 10th level for the transaction to take \r\nplace.

This special ability allows the \r\nConsul to enamor the regional reactions of any kingdom, not just the Ancient Ones, \r\nin a specified region at half the normal cost. However, the chances of success are \r\nonly 76% rather than the normal 100% chance of a normally priced enamor. • Consul Denigrate Region (Order #478, 6,000 gold). This special ability allows the \r\nConsul to denigrate the regional reactions of a kingdom in a specified region at a \r\ndiscounted rate than the normal cost. The chances of success are the same as the \r\nnormal denigration rules, or 35%, whichever is greater. • To bestow a title upon one of our political emissaries (Order #390 Bestow Title), the \r\nConsul must be present at our kingdom’s capital. • A Consul may relocate themselves to another population center (Order #350 Move \r\nEmissary) at a reduced cost of 2,000 gold.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"88c6e6a5-e51b-4dc5-b066-3e6a04387c7d":{"id_":"88c6e6a5-e51b-4dc5-b066-3e6a04387c7d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"g0jazCtKsLfcso1pBW3kWlhK3rabdVh8ADKyp09RY9U=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"F5xt8hDUeDtFGb8pvkWK3C2AG2pw7647qM/rg9PpYVo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6d1baa9c-fedc-4c2a-bc2f-64f1636a8b73","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"WZY4A7oL8xvWXNy5RUKI8NduzAaGwkwXe/yu5gdiO/I="}},"hash":"CSlXsa5zLT8jNtkZx6xbOpPDWSjUeh6L/o908wBj+XI=","text":"• Consuls  may  undertake  nearly  all  of  the  High  Priestess  orders  available,  but  not \r\nthose that require the Devout trait as a prerequisite like the Summon Angels spells.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"16f945ef-efae-4af2-84b9-604f7b6bd590":{"id_":"16f945ef-efae-4af2-84b9-604f7b6bd590","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"Uen7xT9/zXSXOp1/Pv4at7uMjr8EM6xHQgCVQCdKpfo=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"iqcJMp1KmC/94R0UyYUKmIypDgLy95ISGa4AMmUz7mA="}},"hash":"HCQi0hNdQs+RbMkx45cr2IUy8F37Wn6zHHnWeQpMJgA=","text":"118 \r\nThe cost of using the Consul for a High Priestess specific order is the same as that \r\nfor the High Priestess (typically, 7,000 gold). • Whenever a Noble Maiden is hired by another kingdom, our kingdom receives 2,000 \r\ngold. • Sleep (Order  #306,  0  gold).

Our military is \r\nmuch respected and feared by all throughout the realm for \r\nhaving  an  array  of  strengths  amongst  its well-balanced \r\nmilitary. All will comply with our rule! Special Rules for the Everlasting Night of the Deathknights Kingdom: \r\n \r\n• The  Deathknights  are  a  strong  military  kingdom  from  the  nether  regions  whose \r\npurpose  in  existence  is  to  destroy  all  living  life. The  nefarious  nature  of  the \r\nDeathknights vile aura manifests as a continuous Plague in regions where a group \r\nwith at least one brigade of Deathknights resides. The plague wipes out 15% of the \r\npopulation in the entire region, and even depopulates the Deathknights controlled \r\nregion. The plague is an innate ability and cannot be dispelled or prevented though, \r\nthe wizard spells Raise Population Census and Raise Regional Census may increase \r\nthe population levels. The consequence of the ever-present Deathknight plague will \r\ninhibit  recruiting  efforts  from  pop  centers  for  a  number  of  kingdoms,  which \r\nestablishes  a  \"doomsday  clock\"  scenario  if  kingdoms  ever  wish  to  expand  their \r\nmilitaries  in  that  regard. [The  plague  reduces  the  region's  population  levels  to  a \r\nminimum census of 1,000 per pop center] \r\n \r\n• The sheer presence of the Deathknights are so vile that a group with at least one \r\nDeathknight brigade (not invisible) at another kingdom's capital causes their food \r\nstockpile to spoil at three times the normal rate (so 20% food spoilage becomes \r\n60%). Only  a  Scroll  of  Purification  (Spell  #525)  or  a  Preservation  Jar  (Alchemist \r\nonly) may prevent this food loss. • Hell  Hounds (Order  #565  Recruit  Companions)  are  companions  that  are  only \r\navailable for our kingdom.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"aef78b21-e6ef-4fc5-84b7-ec81621a835f":{"id_":"aef78b21-e6ef-4fc5-84b7-ec81621a835f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"Xwr8mzk2gohiKhfLJ07ep5kHhLdK/QAch1i2Sp2ZzqA=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"QzKwwY4wSPFwyIwClRky98i/l3Kkf6wnb789ujgB9fE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"127f74d5-e3df-4a93-8b44-fce4c9e08fd8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"WArgCNcavri4FLNHRxkd1GJFJJ2FnVecbYcDcoywt4o="}},"hash":"9a2t+H3gFjxf0/PkhYcpBmdPO3pvCmAa3yMgtbsBd/A=","text":"During combat, Hell Hounds breathe fire upon their foes, \r\nwhich is the equivalent of a pwr-2 Firestrike spell (increased during Ice Age games). • Summon  Pit  Fiend (unique  for  our  kingdom,  see  wizard  spells).

Armed with an array of special powers and carrying \r\nthe full political weight of a prince, they are indeed formidable \r\nin the extreme. However, many kingdoms may unite to squelch \r\nyour  drive  to  dominance. In  addition,  most  regions  begin \r\ninitially hostile or at best, suspicious.

However,  if  our  ruler  is  assassinated  or  kidnapped,  and  our \r\nkingdom does not have a human Prince or Princess to assume command, one of our \r\nmajestic Demon Princes will be forced to take control of our kingdom. When doing \r\nso, all special abilities of being a Demon Prince become inactive. So, it is in our best \r\ninterests  if  we  enlist  a  number  of  human  Princes  or  Princesses  to  protect  our \r\nDemonic Princes from such an ordeal. • The Demon Princes may perform any of the missions for political emissaries exactly \r\nas a Prince would, and at the same level of political effectiveness. • Gate (Order  #351,  2,000  gold).

Once  constructed,  this  building \r\nallows our kingdom to trade on the open market at an improved 3:2 exchange rate \r\n(normally 3:1). Limits selling on the open market at 100,000 goods maximum. Costs \r\n10,000 food and 15,000 gold to construct and only one may exist for our kingdom. The Hobbit Inc. Trading Company building will be destroyed if ownership of the pop \r\ncenter is lost by any means (may be rebuilt at another location). • Special Order: Reveal All Trades (Order #425, no other columns needed).

The \r\nUnderworld has relied on guile, veiled  threats, and  nerves of \r\nsteel  to  survive,  and  indeed,  prosper. Of  course,  our  Agents \r\nhave been the key to this. The Underworld agents have grown \r\nexpert  at  capturing  some  super-powerful  emissaries  which  is \r\neasier than assassinating those beings, due to karmic patterns \r\nthey  detect. We  have  strengthened  our  grip  over  agents \r\neverywhere. Our navy is formidable - pirates, as it were, which \r\nvery nicely compensate for an anemic army. Politically, we are \r\ncurrently  better  than  average  and  can  claim  good  initial \r\nregional reactions. We are accepted everywhere, if not loved.

In game terms, this is reflected by the Underworld receiving 1,500 gold \r\neach time an agent is hired and each time an agent or fanatic is trained. • Set Global Agent Training Cost (Order #994). As the Underworld sponsors the \r\ntraining of agents throughout the realm, they may set the price of the training for \r\nall kingdoms, which may range from 2,000 gold to 8,000 gold. The initial price of \r\ntraining is 5,000 gold. The Underworld may vary the required amount for everyone \r\nwithin  the  range  by  issuing  this  special  order. Enter  the  new  price  that  will  be \r\nrequired for all kingdoms to pay for their agent training, plus or minus 1,000 gold \r\nfrom  the  current  cost.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"98e8c85e-24f8-412c-a040-67ca0cfdcbf9":{"id_":"98e8c85e-24f8-412c-a040-67ca0cfdcbf9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"CBxPgBGvlPM0yEZ1OYa6+BtaWoXMZFGKNHKgGb5BEPs=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"On8EM5+ue3d3lLYznQdY9nCYTvpqZJR2OcUw+J8+4nw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6df8ab8e-4a3e-458d-b64d-e6f8646558dd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf","file_name":"4th_Cycle_Consolidated_Rulebook.pdf"},"hash":"j2BK2J7T9wy59XoM6lpqV52aXGLiJ3cVc5ovjWt8NFk="}},"hash":"UQSB/wKpTI0s2wm19BN36biRBqIVz3WhdvIT6ruYWbY=","text":"Keep  in  mind  that  increasing  the  global  training  cost  for \r\ndeveloping agents may discourage others from training their agents, which may be \r\nbeneficial  for  our  kingdom  since  there  will  be  fewer  and  lowered-level  agents \r\nperforming counter-espionage/guard to deal with on our missions.

In addition to \r\nthe agent's proficiency, success is dependent upon the rank of the target: more powerful \r\nemissaries are more difficult to assassinate. A low-level agent has virtually no chance of \r\nassassinating a king/queen/regent. An agent guarding the intended victim also severely \r\nlimits the opportunity for a successful assassination. If the assassination succeeds, the \r\nguard may be slain as well. This order will not be allowed on turn 1 and a kingdom may \r\nnever attempt an assassination on a member of his own court. Should the assassination \r\nbe successful any artifacts belonging to this emissary remain with his kingdom. #945 – Assassinate Leader/Wizard \r\nSimilar to Order #940, except the target is a group figure, not an emissary. The group \r\nmust be within the agent's range in order to have an opportunity of succeeding, but the \r\nexact location of the group need not be known.
