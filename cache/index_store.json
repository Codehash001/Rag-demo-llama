AboutConcepts of Biology\r\nConcepts of Biologyis designed for the single-\r\nsemester introduction to biology course for non-\r\nscience majors, which for many students is their only\r\ncollege-level science course. As such, this course\r\nrepresents an important opportunity for students to\r\ndevelop the necessary knowledge, tools, and skills to\r\nmake informed decisions as they continue with their\r\nlives. Rather than being mired down with facts and\r\nvocabulary, the typical non-science major student\r\nneeds information presented in a way that is easy to\r\nread and understand. Even more importantly, the\r\ncontent should be meaningful. Students do much\r\nbetter when they understand why biology is relevant to\r\ntheir everyday lives. For these reasons,Concepts of\r\nBiologyis grounded on an evolutionary basis and\r\nincludes exciting features that highlight careers in the\r\nbiological sciences and everyday applications of the\r\nconcepts at hand. We also strive to show the\r\ninterconnectedness of topics within this extremely\r\nbroad discipline. In order to meet the needs of today’s\r\ninstructors and students, we maintain the overall\r\norganization and coverage found in most syllabi for this\r\ncourse. A strength ofConcepts of Biologyis that\r\ninstructors can customize the book, adapting it to the\r\napproach that works best in their classroom. Concepts\r\nof Biology also includes an innovative art program that\r\nincorporates critical thinking and clicker questions to\r\nhelp students understand—and apply—key concepts.

We also strive to make biology, as\r\na discipline, interesting and accessible to students. In\r\naddition to a comprehensive coverage of core concepts\r\nand foundational research, we have incorporated\r\nfeatures that draw learners into the discipline in\r\nmeaningful ways. Our scope of content was developed\r\nafter surveying over a hundred biology professors and\r\nlistening to their coverage needs. We provide a\r\nthorough treatment of biology’s fundamental concepts\r\nwith a scope that is manageable for instructors and\r\nstudents alike. •  Unit 1:The Cellular Foundation of Life. Our\r\nopening unit introduces students to the sciences,\r\nincluding the process of science and the\r\nunderlying concepts from the physical sciences\r\nthat provide a framework within which learners\r\ncomprehend biological processes. Additionally,\r\nstudents will gain solid understanding of the\r\nstructures, functions, and processes of the most\r\nbasic unit of life: the cell. •  Unit 2:Cell Division and Genetics. Our genetics\r\nunit takes learners from the foundations of cellular\r\nreproduction to the experiments that revealed the\r\nbasis of genetics and laws of inheritance. •  Unit 3:Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. Students will learn the intricacies of DNA, protein\r\nsynthesis, and gene regulation and current\r\napplications of biotechnology and genomics. •  Unit 4:Evolution and the Diversity of Life. The\r\ncore concepts of evolution are discussed in this\r\nunit with examples illustrating evolutionary\r\nprocesses. Additionally, the evolutionary basis of\r\nbiology reappears throughout the textbook in\r\ngeneral discussion and is reinforced through\r\nspecial call-out features highlighting specific\r\nevolution-based topics. The diversity of life is\r\nexplored with detailed study of various organisms\r\nand discussion of emerging phylogenetic\r\nrelationships between and among bacteria, protist\r\nkingdoms, fungi, plants, and animals. •  Unit 5:Animal Structure and Function. An\r\nintroduction to the form and function of the animal\r\nbody is followed by chapters on the immune\r\nsystem and animal development. This unit touches\r\non the biology of all organisms while maintaining\r\nan engaging focus on human anatomy and\r\nphysiology that helps students connect to the\r\ntopics. •  Unit 6:Ecology.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"171f0033-0b56-4ed2-bf71-640d91139ed8":{"id_":"171f0033-0b56-4ed2-bf71-640d91139ed8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"OwjuYze+EwSLAhM280JBv2d5JhILbx3MCg130hq/n7k=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"vQSb95222YMa8efvXLDaLMHVRcfEDqPhaLUrTl9YY5A="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4b1ebe02-dde3-4567-94f0-72f3f2cbc386","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"wPOojhNpOCixRz8p8MkkWZoQY5nYhfC/pGFEYIMugYc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"95367c09-94b0-4093-9843-53d410f25072","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"J6cjb6VKgdzneHOX33TllzzUlBIWuqzJEFX+KAnhexQ="}},"hash":"gpQTLHz1VryrAueCqgIbwySWi+9n1vzRvVusMuXcWQ4=","text":"•  Unit 6:Ecology. Ecological concepts are broadly\r\ncovered in this unit, with features highlighting\r\nlocalized, real-world issues of conservation and\r\nbiodiversity. Pedagogical Foundation and Features\r\nBecause of the impact science has on students and\r\nsociety, an important goal of science education is to\r\nachieve a scientifically literate population that\r\nconsistently makes informed decisions. Scientific\r\nliteracy transcends a basic understanding of scientific\r\nprinciples and processes to include the ability to make\r\nsense of the myriad instances where people encounter\r\nscience in day-to-day life. Thus, a scientifically literate\r\nperson is one who uses science content knowledge to\r\nmake informed decisions, either personally or socially,\r\nabout topics or issues that have a connection with\r\nscience. Concepts of Biology is grounded on a solid\r\nscientific base and designed to promote scientific\r\nliteracy. Throughout the text, you will find features that\r\nengage the students in scientific inquiry by taking\r\nselected topics a step further. •Evolution Connectionfeatures uphold the\r\nimportance of evolution to all biological study\r\nthrough discussions like “Global Decline of Coral\r\nReefs” and “The Red Queen Hypothesis. ”\r\n•Career Connectionfeatures present information\r\non a variety of careers in the biological sciences,\r\nintroducing students to the educational\r\nrequirements and day-to-day work life of a variety\r\nof professions, such as forensic scientists,\r\nregistered dietitians, and biogeographers. •Everyday Connectionfeatures tie biological\r\nconcepts to emerging issues and discuss science\r\nin terms of everyday life. Topics include “Invasive\r\nSpecies” and “Photosynthesis at the Grocery\r\nStore. ”\r\nAnswers to Questions in the Book\r\nAnswers to Visual Connection Questions, Review\r\nQuestions, and Critical Thinking Questions are provided\r\nin the Instructor Answer Guide via the Instructor\r\nResources page. Select answers to these questions are\r\nprovided for students via the Student Resources page. Art and Animations that Engage\r\nOur art program takes a straightforward approach\r\ndesigned to help students learn the concepts of biology\r\nthrough simple, effective illustrations, photos, and\r\nmicrographs.

From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with four questions: What are the shared\r\nproperties that make something “alive”? How do those various living things function? When faced\r\nwith the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that\r\nwe can better understand them? And, finally—what biologists ultimately seek to understand—how\r\ndid this diversity arise and how is it continuing? As new organisms are discovered every day,\r\nbiologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions. Properties of Life\r\nAll groups of living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or\r\nresponse to stimuli, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation/homeostasis,\r\nenergy processing, and evolution. When viewed together, these eight characteristics serve to\r\ndefine life. Order\r\nOrganisms are highly organized structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple,\r\nsingle-celled organisms are remarkably complex. Inside each cell, atoms make up molecules. These in turn make up cell components or organelles. Multicellular organisms, which may consist\r\nof millions of individual cells, have an advantage over single-celled organisms in that their cells\r\ncan be specialized to perform specific functions, and even sacrificed in certain situations for the\r\ngood of the organism as a whole. How these specialized cells come together to form organs such\r\nas the heart, lung, or skin in organisms like the toad shown inFigure 1.2will be discussed later. FIGURE 1.2A toad represents a highly organized structure consisting of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.(credit: \"Ivengo(RUS)\"/Wikimedia Commons)\r\nSensitivity or Response to Stimuli\r\nOrganisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light or\r\nrespond to touch (Figure 1.3). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a\r\nprocess called chemotaxis) or light (phototaxis). Movement toward a stimulus is considered a\r\npositive response, while movement away from a stimulus is considered a negative response. 6               1 • Introduction to Biology\r\nAccess for free at openstax.org","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e696ee84-aae9-44d6-8800-12b006f47d5b":{"id_":"e696ee84-aae9-44d6-8800-12b006f47d5b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"hxfQrBsLZ/iIWFRg1MGTsddm+ATtGgsqpG0AgB9Yg3Q=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"MDEoRzgWwE6YIPvte6X7Z3hSUjzswLvcCWD0x/rUcFI="}},"hash":"mbmoeV0hjPhquFUzP1U5Y1F7BdPLaTq0Z6GjxGn2rGs=","text":"FIGURE 1.3The leaves of this sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched.

Reproduction\r\nSingle-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, which is the genetic material, and then dividing it\r\nequally as the cell prepares to divide to form two new cells. Many multicellular organisms (those made up of more\r\nthan one cell) produce specialized reproductive cells that will form new individuals. When reproduction occurs, DNA\r\ncontaining genes is passed along to an organism’s offspring. These genes are the reason that the offspring will\r\nbelong to the same species and will have characteristics similar to the parent, such as fur color and blood type. Adaptation\r\nAll living organisms exhibit a “fit” to their environment. Biologists refer to this fit as adaptation and it is a\r\nconsequence of evolution by natural selection, which operates in every lineage of reproducing organisms. Examples\r\nof adaptations are diverse and unique, from heat-resistant Archaea that live in boiling hot springs to the tongue\r\nlength of a nectar-feeding moth that matches the size of the flower from which it feeds. Adaptations enhance the\r\nreproductive potential of the individual exhibiting them, including their ability to survive to reproduce. Adaptations\r\nare not constant. As an environment changes, natural selection causes the characteristics of the individuals in a\r\npopulation to track those changes. Growth and Development\r\nOrganisms grow and develop according to specific instructions coded for by their genes. These genes provide\r\ninstructions that will direct cellular growth and development, ensuring that a species’ young (Figure 1.4) will grow\r\nup to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its parents. 1.1 • Themes and Concepts of Biology               7","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e82dfc0c-b056-49ef-8591-138c23366319":{"id_":"e82dfc0c-b056-49ef-8591-138c23366319","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"WoMW4ZCiE7EuZRE2DnxMuAMuqgHpoRZdOvbZcZnkIbs=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"5Gddsx2Q/RCdrmFb54kMtTvn9VTJDkfHUrxiRqAdw3U="}},"hash":"m/2rooSlWbcsDUF8EUz4Wy7SVSQ6vUakg1FPQ1qnLTg=","text":"FIGURE 1.4Although no two look alike, these kittens have inherited genes from both parents and share many of the same characteristics.(credit: Pieter & Renée Lanser)\r\nRegulation/Homeostasis\r\nEven the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal\r\nfunctions, such as the transport of nutrients, response to stimuli, and coping with environmental stresses. Homeostasis(literally, “steady state”) refers to the relatively stable internal environment required to maintain life. For example, organ systems such as the digestive or circulatory systems perform specific functions like carrying\r\noxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body. To function properly, cells require appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and concentrations of\r\ndiverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms are able to\r\nmaintain homeostatic internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes,\r\nby activation of regulatory mechanisms. For example, many organisms regulate their body temperature in a process\r\nknown as thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (Figure 1.5), have body\r\nstructures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. In hot climates, organisms have\r\nmethods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat. FIGURE 1.5Polar bears and other mammals living in ice-covered regions maintain their body temperature by generating heat and reducingheat loss through thick fur and a dense layer of fat under their skin. (credit: \"longhorndave\"/Flickr)\r\nEnergy Processing\r\nAll organisms (such as the California condor shown inFigure 1.6) use a source of energy for their metabolic\r\nactivities. Some organisms capture energy from the Sun and convert it into chemical energy in food; others use\r\nchemical energy from molecules they take in. 8               1 • Introduction to Biology\r\nAccess for free at openstax.org","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"30769813-e774-4d45-92f6-dd4bc4732a3d":{"id_":"30769813-e774-4d45-92f6-dd4bc4732a3d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"yZluLe5vnMUQcrBVcH0Eyu922va2D/xRhjQP2FgvEW4=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"xD4HLBj5umVKnBXnAfAR7sbEpeWSobDdkNZ2UxFIn54="}},"hash":"ouq4qwYrQdRF03PSTHYmwFZ5o/y5Hwsw8A58dhLWq8U=","text":"FIGURE 1.6A lot of energy is required for a California condor to fly.

These\r\nmutations allow the possibility for organisms to adapt to a changing environment. An organism that evolves\r\ncharacteristics fit for the environment will have greater reproductive success, subject to the forces of natural\r\nselection. Levels of Organization of Living Things\r\nLiving things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy on a scale from small to large. Theatomis\r\nthe smallest and most fundamental unit of matter that retains the properties of an element. It consists of a nucleus\r\nsurrounded by electrons. Atoms form molecules. Amoleculeis a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms\r\nheld together by a chemical bond. Many molecules that are biologically important aremacromolecules, large\r\nmolecules that are typically formed by combining smaller units called monomers. An example of a macromolecule is\r\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Figure 1.7), which contains the instructions for the functioning of the organism that\r\ncontains it. 1.1 • Themes and Concepts of Biology               9","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"50c552a1-9717-4e04-adec-496cee50a017":{"id_":"50c552a1-9717-4e04-adec-496cee50a017","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"LYa5uoPHnzxEXoag5UOjjQDrnI9TbDmx7MJBbmZ1fvI=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"wwcZq894yxcm4dRgQsz2idzu7Fj0Oy3f2DnkKWz1kio="}},"hash":"CARJme1pCHp6e3deesZn0rDSiRwi8luTbkM/cIgf5ZQ=","text":"FIGURE 1.7A molecule, like this large DNA molecule, is composed of atoms.

Some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are calledorganelles. Organelles are small structures that exist within cells and perform specialized functions. All living things are made of\r\ncells; thecellitself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. (This requirement\r\nis why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and\r\nhijack a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce. ) Some organisms consist of a\r\nsingle cell and others are multicellular. Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic.Prokaryotesare single-\r\ncelled organisms that lack organelles surrounded by a membrane and do not have nuclei surrounded by nuclear\r\nmembranes; in contrast, the cells ofeukaryotesdo have membrane-bound organelles and nuclei. In most multicellular organisms, cells combine to maketissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out the\r\nsame function.Organsare collections of tissues grouped together based on a common function. Organs are present\r\nnot only in animals but also in plants. Anorgan systemis a higher level of organization that consists of functionally\r\nrelated organs. For example vertebrate animals have many organ systems, such as the circulatory system that\r\ntransports blood throughout the body and to and from the lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and blood\r\nvessels.Organismsare individual living entities. For example, each tree in a forest is an organism. Single-celled\r\nprokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms and are typically referred to as\r\nmicroorganisms. 10               1 • Introduction to Biology\r\nAccess for free at openstax.org","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"aab49bd4-5cde-4318-9cb6-7e2edb5ec0a8":{"id_":"aab49bd4-5cde-4318-9cb6-7e2edb5ec0a8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9DGbUtC1sPELxCBnkCfR/z2jy4UX5aD4pH3PwnbCA74=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"mxe8yfFL43jhXnnKhFFSEk/kMyFPOkj4peOOo0ME30Y="}},"hash":"/RaRtUOSIe1hJN6HAGImNqQCL7Hbssi+yq9I7w69erE=","text":"VISUAL CONNECTION\r\nFIGURE 1.8From an atom to the entire Earth, biology examines all aspects of life.

The source of\r\nthis diversity isevolution, the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species. Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems. In the 18th century, a scientist named Carl Linnaeus first proposed organizing the known species of organisms into a\r\nhierarchical taxonomy. In this system, species that are most similar to each other are put together within a grouping\r\nknown as a genus. Furthermore, similar genera (the plural of genus) are put together within a family. This grouping\r\ncontinues until all organisms are collected together into groups at the highest level. The current taxonomic system\r\nnow has eight levels in its hierarchy, from lowest to highest, they are: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum,\r\nkingdom, domain. Thus species are grouped within genera, genera are grouped within families, families are grouped\r\nwithin orders, and so on (Figure 1.9).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"868469f8-b764-42f5-bf1e-d147b351e069":{"id_":"868469f8-b764-42f5-bf1e-d147b351e069","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"4DURkn8FDZ66rAi95eFGO78RgkJFmeqU7oGZ97hMclU=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"w9thWk3pZ4mU0TfDB7iunoPU7ULTrIC48q5emhWqfQg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ce3e7b30-9e36-4d4a-bff7-fd95f793ee5d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"hChvDUSM0c51W9iY6kidx6fenAuiNuYWjNdb6S+hL9g="}},"hash":"IqNCypXL0X2A0XcRD6YARoN8y8RAu4LsqKWMHMzuac0=","text":"FIGURE 1.9This diagram shows the levels of taxonomic hierarchy for a dog, from the broadest category—domain—to the mostspecific—species.

The domain Eukarya contains organisms that have cells\r\nwith nuclei. It includes the kingdoms of fungi, plants, animals, and several kingdoms of protists. The Archaea, are\r\nsingle-celled organisms without nuclei and include many extremophiles that live in harsh environments like hot\r\nsprings. The Bacteria are another quite different group of single-celled organisms without nuclei (Figure 1.10). Both\r\nthe Archaea and the Bacteria are prokaryotes, an informal name for cells without nuclei. The recognition in the\r\n1970s that certain “bacteria,” now known as the Archaea, were as different genetically and biochemically from\r\nother bacterial cells as they were from eukaryotes, motivated the recommendation to divide life into three domains.

A phylogenetic tree is composed of branch points, or\r\nnodes, and branches. The internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when, based on scientific\r\nevidence, an ancestor is thought to have diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch can be\r\nconsidered as estimates of relative time. In the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria.

Microbiology is the study of the structure and function of microorganisms. It is quite a\r\nbroad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study, there are also microbial physiologists, ecologists, and\r\ngeneticists, among others. Another field of biological study, neurobiology, studies the biology of the nervous system, and although it is\r\nconsidered a branch of biology, it is also recognized as an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience. Because of its interdisciplinary nature, this sub discipline studies different functions of the nervous system using\r\nmolecular, cellular, developmental, medical, and computational approaches.

Biotechnologists apply the knowledge of biology to create useful products. Ecologists study the interactions of organisms in their environments. Physiologists study the workings of cells,\r\ntissues and organs. This is just a small sample of the many fields that biologists can pursue.

They\r\nalso must ensure that their research and communications are free of bias and that they properly balance financial,\r\nlegal, safety, replicability, and other considerations. Bioethics is an important and continually evolving field, in which\r\nresearchers collaborate with other thinkers and organizations. They work to define guidelines for current practice,\r\nand also continually consider new developments and emerging technologies in order to form answers for the years\r\nand decades to come. Unfortunately, the emergence of bioethics as a field came after a number of clearly unethical practices, where\r\nbiologists did not treat research subjects with dignity and in some cases did them harm. In the 1932 Tuskegee\r\nsyphilis study, 399 African American men were diagnosed with syphilis but were never informed that they had the\r\ndisease, leaving them to live with and pass on the illness to others. Doctors even withheld proven medications\r\nbecause the goal of the study was to understand the impact of untreated syphilis on Black men. While the decisions made in the Tuskegee study are unjustifiable, some decisions are genuinely difficult to make. For example, bioethicists may examine the implications of gene editing technologies, including the ability to create\r\norganisms that may displace others in the environment, as well as the ability to “design” human beings. In that\r\neffort, ethicists will likely seek to balance the positive outcomes -- such as improved therapies or prevention of\r\ncertain illnesses -- with negative outcomes. Bioethics are not simple, and often leave scientists balancing benefits with harm. In this text and course, you will\r\ndiscuss medical discoveries that, at their core, have what many consider an ethical lapse. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks,\r\na 30-year-old African American woman, was diagnosed with cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Unique\r\ncharacteristics of her illnesses gave her cells the ability to divide continuously, essentially making them “immortal. ”\r\nWithout her knowledge or permission, researchers took samples of her cells and with them created the immortal\r\nHeLa cell line. These cells have contributed to major medical discoveries, including the polio vaccine and work\r\nrelated to cancer, AIDS, cell aging, and even very recently in COVID-19 research.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"88d655a0-3961-4048-87cd-256f2dfb2a02":{"id_":"88d655a0-3961-4048-87cd-256f2dfb2a02","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"EwiVy4BfieVBiZtY6USfzOILPcLazpcbpTxpq4dSAWA=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"keBNeFAc3+QE8l4HalCBhAMGQ7Q0a38LqDt01+sXyzU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1d543f83-2710-43bf-ac6d-b8afb51a1046","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"oPECy9lyqwC9gz4ivcBEb0v8HR7sx8J7Y/Wx71wO3J0="}},"hash":"JswUfYlgCcX+8NWswiKLybENp5GyyUbS3UOqzHyOFnw=","text":"For the most part, Lacks has not\r\nbeen credited for her role in those discoveries, and her family has not benefited from the billions of dollars in\r\npharmaceutical profits obtained partly through the use of her cells.

Specifically, biology is the study of life. The discoveries of biology are made by a community of researchers who\r\nwork individually and together using agreed-on methods. In this sense, biology, like all sciences is a social\r\nenterprise like politics or the arts. The methods of science include careful observation, record keeping, logical and\r\nmathematical reasoning, experimentation, and submitting conclusions to the scrutiny of others. Science also\r\nrequires considerable imagination and creativity; a well-designed experiment is commonly described as elegant, or\r\nbeautiful. Like politics, science has considerable practical implications and some science is dedicated to practical\r\napplications, such as the prevention of disease (seeFigure 1.15). Other science proceeds largely motivated by\r\ncuriosity. Whatever its goal, there is no doubt that science, including biology, has transformed human existence and\r\nwill continue to do so.

There are however, areas of knowledge and human\r\nexperience that the methods of science cannot be applied to. These include such things as answering purely moral\r\nquestions, aesthetic questions, or what can be generally categorized as spiritual questions. Science cannot\r\ninvestigate these areas because they are outside the realm of material phenomena, the phenomena of matter and\r\nenergy, and cannot be observed and measured. Thescientific methodis a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation. The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this\r\nmethod is the testing of hypotheses. Ahypothesisis a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested. Hypotheses, or tentative explanations, are generally produced within the context of ascientific theory. A generally\r\naccepted scientific theory is thoroughly tested and confirmed explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. Scientific theory is the foundation of scientific knowledge. In addition, in many scientific disciplines (less so in\r\nbiology) there arescientific laws, often expressed in mathematical formulas, which describe how elements of\r\nnature will behave under certain specific conditions. There is not an evolution of hypotheses through theories to\r\nlaws as if they represented some increase in certainty about the world. Hypotheses are the day-to-day material that\r\nscientists work with and they are developed within the context of theories.

Inductive reasoningis a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion. This type of reasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and\r\nrecords them. These data can be qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (consisting of numbers), and the raw data\r\ncan be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many observations, the scientist can infer\r\nconclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from\r\ncareful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain studies often work this way. Many brains are\r\nobserved while people are doing a task. The part of the brain that lights up, indicating activity, is then demonstrated\r\nto be the part controlling the response to that task. Deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reasoning, the\r\npattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning.Deductive reasoningis a\r\nform of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to predict specific results. From those general principles,\r\na scientist can deduce and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. For example, a prediction would be that if the climate is becoming warmer in a region, the distribution of plants and\r\nanimals should change. Comparisons have been made between distributions in the past and the present, and the\r\nmany changes that have been found are consistent with a warming climate. Finding the change in distribution is\r\nevidence that the climate change conclusion is a valid one. Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and\r\nhypothesis-based science.Descriptive(or discovery)scienceaims to observe, explore, and discover, while\r\nhypothesis-based sciencebegins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be\r\ntested. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, because most scientific endeavors\r\ncombine both approaches. Observations lead to questions, questions lead to forming a hypothesis as a possible\r\nanswer to those questions, and then the hypothesis is tested. Thus, descriptive science and hypothesis-based\r\nscience are in continuous dialogue.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"954f39e7-4185-4251-b3da-beff4cd990c6":{"id_":"954f39e7-4185-4251-b3da-beff4cd990c6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"03IgRneHVgk0HBMa/C/JKNnxY4O9HGYxtDvhSUSfJLc=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"umf2/D/FJLfcCezI74/LweXIdNrBqwta+PrOMYTXfAY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3a2ae5dc-349e-4628-a260-701c1aecb87a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"mHu0mkmhNyJVQc+0JiMwiO/yc3GUlgoMXZCsehppCI8="}},"hash":"oxCPOK5hNoX1Okhz5BshDV1rvFacsveW2JXBrrwtHZA=","text":"Thus, descriptive science and hypothesis-based\r\nscience are in continuous dialogue.

One Monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That\r\nis an observation that also describes a problem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: “Why\r\nis the classroom so warm? ”\r\nRecall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested. To solve a problem, several hypotheses may\r\nbe proposed. For example, one hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because no one turned on the air\r\nconditioning. ” But there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be\r\nproposed. A second hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air\r\nconditioning doesn’t work. ”\r\nOnce a hypothesis has been selected, a prediction may be made. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it\r\ntypically has the format “If . . . then . . . . ” For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, “Ifthe\r\nstudent turns on the air conditioning,thenthe classroom will no longer be too warm. ”\r\nA hypothesis must be testable to ensure that it is valid. For example, a hypothesis that depends on what a bear\r\nthinks is not testable, because it can never be known what a bear thinks. It should also befalsifiable, meaning that\r\nit can be disproven by experimental results. An example of an unfalsifiable hypothesis is “Botticelli’sBirth of Venus\r\nis beautiful. ” There is no experiment that might show this statement to be false. To test a hypothesis, a researcher\r\nwill conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. This is important. A\r\nhypothesis can be disproven, or eliminated, but it can never be proven.

If an experiment fails to disprove a hypothesis, then we find support for that explanation, but this is\r\nnot to say that down the road a better explanation will not be found, or a more carefully designed experiment will be\r\nfound to falsify the hypothesis. Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls. Avariableis any part of the experiment\r\nthat can vary or change during the experiment. Acontrolis a part of the experiment that does not change. Look for\r\nthe variables and controls in the example that follows. As a simple example, an experiment might be conducted to\r\ntest the hypothesis that phosphate limits the growth of algae in freshwater ponds. A series of artificial ponds are\r\nfilled with water and half of them are treated by adding phosphate each week, while the other half are treated by\r\nadding a salt that is known not to be used by algae. The variable here is the phosphate (or lack of phosphate), the\r\nexperimental or treatment cases are the ponds with added phosphate and the control ponds are those with\r\nsomething inert added, such as the salt. Just adding something is also a control against the possibility that adding\r\nextra matter to the pond has an effect. If the treated ponds show lesser growth of algae, then we have found\r\nsupport for our hypothesis. If they do not, then we reject our hypothesis. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis\r\ndoes not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates one hypothesis that\r\nis not valid (Figure 1.18). Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data\r\nare rejected. In recent years a new approach of testing hypotheses has developed as a result of an exponential growth of data\r\ndeposited in various databases. Using computer algorithms and statistical analyses of data in databases, a new field\r\nof so-called \"data research\" (also referred to as \"in silico\" research) provides new methods of data analyses and\r\ntheir interpretation.

This question focuses on the differences\r\nbetween two types of science: basic science and applied science. Basic scienceor “pure” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that\r\nknowledge. It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The\r\nimmediate goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledge’s sake, though this does not mean that in the end it\r\nmay not result in an application. In contrast,applied scienceor “technology,” aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible,\r\nfor example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural\r\ndisaster. In applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher. Some individuals may perceive applied science as “useful” and basic science as “useless. ” A question these people\r\nmight pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, “What for? ” A careful look at the history of\r\nscience, however, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. Many\r\nscientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before an application is developed; therefore,\r\napplied science relies on the results generated through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move\r\non from basic science and instead to find solutions to actual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that\r\nthere are problems that demand immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of\r\nthe knowledge generated through basic science. One example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the\r\ndiscovery of DNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication. Strands of DNA, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life. During DNA replication, new copies of DNA are made, shortly before a cell divides to form new cells. Understanding\r\nthe mechanisms of DNA replication enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to\r\nidentify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine paternity.

An unwanted mold grew, killing the bacteria. The mold turned out to bePenicillium, and a new critically\r\nimportant antibiotic was discovered. In a similar manner, Percy Lavon Julian was an established medicinal chemist\r\nworking on a way to mass produce compounds with which to manufacture important drugs. He was focused on\r\nusing soybean oil in the production of progesterone (a hormone important in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy),\r\nbut it wasn't until water accidentally leaked into a large soybean oil storage tank that he found his method. Immediately recognizing the resulting substance as stigmasterol, a primary ingredient in progesterone and similar\r\ndrugs, he began the process of replicating and industrializing the process in a manner that has helped millions of\r\npeople. Even in the highly organized world of science, luck—when combined with an observant, curious mind\r\nfocused on the types of reasoning discussed above—can lead to unexpected breakthroughs. Reporting Scientific Work\r\nWhether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings for other\r\nresearchers to expand and build upon their discoveries. Communication and collaboration within and between sub\r\ndisciplines of science are key to the advancement of knowledge in science. For this reason, an important aspect of a\r\nscientist’s work is disseminating results and communicating with peers. Scientists can share results by presenting\r\nthem at a scientific meeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the limited few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed articles that are published in scientific journals. Peer-reviewed articlesare scientific papers that are reviewed, usually anonymously by a scientist’s colleagues, or\r\npeers. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who judge whether or not\r\nthe scientist’s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research\r\ndescribed in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which\r\nare requests for research funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their work so other scientists\r\ncan reproduce their experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings. There are many journals and the popular press that do not use a peer-review system.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"ab022644-f9bc-42bc-9c07-e9917d48b4c3":{"id_":"ab022644-f9bc-42bc-9c07-e9917d48b4c3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"c3w6YLWcm4wX0fHcUZ2au9QQrNdQDU+IijVBIfEPJUU=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"xukc1DkPfGKIDn2bWxqucfc3QFJD87JztjL50qEJUGY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bbce091e-ad1f-49be-b8f1-6d731574de0d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"CDj2IxFsxYA/LotaJQevuj6Fglj3QmXeBmbBNRYjM3U="}},"hash":"D+I3nWXKg0fmHnxKLn+xVbDpl0tgN3NdEhLlM74xdWA=","text":"There are many journals and the popular press that do not use a peer-review system.

Science attempts to describe and\r\nunderstand the nature of the universe in whole or in\r\npart. Science has many fields; those fields related to\r\nthe physical world and its phenomena are considered\r\nnatural sciences. A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for an\r\nobservation. A generally accepted scientific theory is\r\nthoroughly tested and confirmed explanation for a set\r\nof observations or phenomena. A scientific law is a\r\ndescription, often in the form of a mathematical\r\nformula, of the behavior of an aspect of nature under\r\ncertain circumstances. Two types of logical reasoning\r\nare used in science. Inductive reasoning uses results to\r\nproduce general scientific principles. Deductive\r\nreasoning is a form of logical thinking that predicts\r\nresults by applying general principles. The common\r\nthread throughout scientific research is the use of the\r\nscientific method. Scientists present their results in\r\npeer-reviewed scientific papers published in scientific\r\njournals. Science can be basic or applied. The main goal of basic\r\nscience is to expand knowledge without any\r\nexpectation of short-term practical application of that\r\nknowledge.

All\r\nmatter is composed ofelements, substances that cannot be broken down or transformed\r\nchemically into other substances. Each element is made of atoms, each with a constant number of\r\nprotons and unique properties. A total of 118 elements have been defined; however, only 92 occur\r\nnaturally, and fewer than 30 are found in living cells. The remaining 26 elements are unstable and,\r\ntherefore, do not exist for very long or are theoretical and have yet to be detected. Each element is designated by its chemical symbol (such as H, N, O, C, and Na), and possesses\r\nunique properties. These unique properties allow elements to combine and to bond with each\r\nother in specific ways. Atoms\r\nAn atom is the smallest component of an element that retains all of the chemical properties of\r\nthat element. For example, one hydrogen atom has all of the properties of the element hydrogen,\r\nsuch as it exists as a gas at room temperature, and it bonds with oxygen to create a water\r\nmolecule. Hydrogen atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the\r\nproperties of hydrogen. If a hydrogen atom were broken down into subatomic particles, it would\r\nno longer have the properties of hydrogen. At the most basic level, all organisms are made of a combination of elements. They contain atoms\r\nthat combine together to form molecules. In multicellular organisms, such as animals, molecules\r\ncan interact to form cells that combine to form tissues, which make up organs.

The number of electrons does not factor into the overall mass, because their mass is so\r\nsmall. As stated earlier, each element has its own unique properties. Each contains a different number of protons and\r\nneutrons, giving it its own atomic number and mass number. Theatomic numberof an element is equal to the\r\nnumber of protons that element contains. Themass number, or atomic mass, is the number of protons plus the\r\nnumber of neutrons of that element. Therefore, it is possible to determine the number of neutrons by subtracting\r\nthe atomic number from the mass number. These numbers provide information about the elements and how they will react when combined. Different elements\r\nhave different melting and boiling points, and are in different states (liquid, solid, or gas) at room temperature. They\r\nalso combine in different ways. Some form specific types of bonds, whereas others do not. How they combine is\r\nbased on the number of electrons present. Because of these characteristics, the elements are arranged into the\r\nperiodic table of elements, a chart of the elements that includes the atomic number and relative atomic mass of\r\neach element. The periodic table also provides key information about the properties of elements (Figure 2.2)—often\r\nindicated by color-coding.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION\r\nCarbon Dating\r\nCarbon-14 (14C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. This is a\r\ncontinuous process, so more14C is always being created. As a living organism develops, the relative level of14C in\r\nits body is equal to the concentration of14C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting14C,\r\nso the ratio will decline.14C decays to14N by a process called beta decay; it gives off energy in this slow process. After approximately 5,730 years, only one-half of the starting concentration of14C will have been converted to14N. The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay to its more stable form is called its half-\r\nlife. Because the half-life of14C is long, it is used to age formerly living objects, such as fossils. Using the ratio of the\r\n14C concentration found in an object to the amount of14C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope\r\nthat has not yet decayed can be determined. Based on this amount, the age of the fossil can be calculated to about\r\n50,000 years (Figure 2.4). Isotopes with longer half-lives, such as potassium-40, are used to calculate the ages of\r\nolder fossils. Through the use of carbon dating, scientists can reconstruct the ecology and biogeography of\r\norganisms living within the past 50,000 years. 30               2 • Chemistry of Life\r\nAccess for free at openstax.org","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"7bacb541-31fd-456c-ac8c-13e2fb4979fd":{"id_":"7bacb541-31fd-456c-ac8c-13e2fb4979fd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"SXRuHPGJUdFrnNjg5l+NTl3L3fpR9ZD9RhwnK61Kkog=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"D5iz5vcCxUVBO4q1B3R7hf5XTI8HfCuVKRzFlVKmLQI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c08cbd25-d1f9-40d8-909d-5936e1e32ed2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"z7VfIXdV+cvlekpzI6HBh9h9VGNHr4ElZTqdw4GhaZ4="}},"hash":"Doc8mFjQ8Z/A1YN7sQccKuijdvoXnsaf7fVnk5S/VAM=","text":"FIGURE 2.4The age of remains that contain carbon and are less than about 50,000 years old, such as this pygmy mammoth, can bedetermined using carbon dating.

Chemical Bonds\r\nHow elements interact with one another depends on how their electrons are arranged and how many openings for\r\nelectrons exist at the outermost region where electrons are present in an atom. Electrons exist at energy levels that\r\nform shells around the nucleus. The closest shell can hold up to two electrons. The closest shell to the nucleus is\r\nalways filled first, before any other shell can be filled. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot\r\noccupied within the lowest shell. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the lowest shell with its\r\ntwo electrons. If you look at the periodic table, you will see that hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in\r\nthe first row. This is because they only have electrons in their first shell. Hydrogen and helium are the only two\r\nelements that have the lowest shell and no other shells. The second and third energy levels can hold up to eight electrons. The eight electrons are arranged in four pairs and\r\none position in each pair is filled with an electron before any pairs are completed. Looking at the periodic table again (Figure 2.3), you will notice that there are seven rows. These rows correspond to\r\nthe number of shells that the elements within that row have. The elements within a particular row have increasing\r\nnumbers of electrons as the columns proceed from left to right. Although each element has the same number of\r\nshells, not all of the shells are completely filled with electrons. If you look at the second row of the periodic table,\r\nyou will find lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and neon (Ne). These all have electrons that occupy only the first and second shells.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"c08cbd25-d1f9-40d8-909d-5936e1e32ed2":{"id_":"c08cbd25-d1f9-40d8-909d-5936e1e32ed2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"SXRuHPGJUdFrnNjg5l+NTl3L3fpR9ZD9RhwnK61Kkog=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"D5iz5vcCxUVBO4q1B3R7hf5XTI8HfCuVKRzFlVKmLQI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7bacb541-31fd-456c-ac8c-13e2fb4979fd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"Doc8mFjQ8Z/A1YN7sQccKuijdvoXnsaf7fVnk5S/VAM="}},"hash":"z7VfIXdV+cvlekpzI6HBh9h9VGNHr4ElZTqdw4GhaZ4=","text":"These all have electrons that occupy only the first and second shells.

To completely fill the outer shell of an oxygen atom, two electrons from two\r\nhydrogen atoms are needed, hence the subscript “2” in H2O. The electrons are shared between the atoms, dividing\r\ntheir time between them to “fill” the outer shell of each.

Two covalent bonds form between the two oxygen atoms because\r\noxygen requires two shared electrons to fill its outermost shell. Nitrogen atoms will form three covalent bonds (also\r\ncalled triple covalent) between two atoms of nitrogen because each nitrogen atom needs three electrons to fill its\r\noutermost shell. Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is found in the methane (CH4) molecule. The carbon\r\natom has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen\r\natoms, each atom providing one. These elements all share the electrons equally, creating four nonpolar covalent\r\nbonds (Figure 2.6). In apolar covalent bond, the electrons shared by the atoms spend more time closer to one nucleus than to the\r\nother nucleus. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the different nuclei, a slightly positive (δ+)\r\nor slightly negative (δ–) charge develops. The covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are\r\npolar covalent bonds.

Hydrogen bonds can form between different molecules and they do not always have to include a water molecule. Hydrogen atoms in polar bonds within any molecule can form bonds with other adjacent molecules.

CAREER CONNECTION\r\nRadiography Technician\r\nHave you or anyone you know ever had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, a mammogram, or an X-ray? These tests produce images of your soft tissues and organs (as with an MRI or mammogram) or your bones (as\r\nhappens in an X-ray) by using either radiowaves or special isotopes (radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled) that are\r\ningested or injected into the body. These tests provide data for disease diagnoses by creating images of your organs\r\nor skeletal system. MRI imaging works by subjecting hydrogen nuclei, which are abundant in the water in soft tissues, to fluctuating\r\nmagnetic fields, which cause them to emit their own magnetic field. This signal is then read by sensors in the\r\nmachine and interpreted by a computer to form a detailed image. Some radiography technologists and technicians specialize in computed tomography, MRI, and mammography. They\r\nproduce films or images of the body that help medical professionals examine and diagnose. Radiologists work\r\ndirectly with patients, explaining machinery, preparing them for exams, and ensuring that their body or body parts\r\nare positioned correctly to produce the needed images. Physicians or radiologists then analyze the test results. Radiography technicians can work in hospitals, doctors’ offices, or specialized imaging centers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"c9645f5f-ec2e-4df6-b33e-658c8b58a394":{"id_":"c9645f5f-ec2e-4df6-b33e-658c8b58a394","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"Pv15cUxGYQlFWd4bU67dSB80GBeFD7fHHR0W2l3PiOU=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"qh3StgVhnjCmMiTztpocx1TWaDFCDdJA51DVGBJE6pk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"46acd8b9-de07-483d-b290-b9a749f24230","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"xrqN2l97sH263+L8LBhwLwWsxwnJDUYOSlUbhl0b4do="}},"hash":"y2mdPN+wL7wTpnhGgSFZHXuIL70H3Cn25HwPIIJ58bg=","text":"Radiography technicians can work in hospitals, doctors’ offices, or specialized imaging centers.

Approximately 60–70\r\npercent of your body is made up of water. Without it, life simply would not exist. Water Is Polar\r\nThe hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water molecules form polar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend\r\nmore time associated with the oxygen atom than they do with hydrogen atoms. There is no overall charge to a water\r\nmolecule, but there is a slight positive charge on each hydrogen atom and a slight negative charge on the oxygen\r\natom. Because of these charges, the slightly positive hydrogen atoms repel each other and form the unique shape\r\nseen inFigure 2.7. Each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the positive and negative\r\ncharges in the different parts of the molecule. Water also attracts other polar molecules (such as sugars), forming\r\nhydrogen bonds. When a substance readily forms hydrogen bonds with water, it can dissolve in water and is referred\r\nto ashydrophilic(“water-loving”). Hydrogen bonds are not readily formed with nonpolar substances like oils and\r\nfats (Figure 2.8). These nonpolar compounds arehydrophobic(“water-fearing”) and will not dissolve in water. FIGURE 2.8As this macroscopic image of oil and water show, oil is a nonpolar compound and, hence, will not dissolve in water. Oil andwater do not mix. (credit: Gautam Dogra)\r\nWater Stabilizes Temperature\r\nThe hydrogen bonds in water allow it to absorb and release heat energy more slowly than many other substances. Temperatureis a measure of the motion (kinetic energy) of molecules. As the motion increases, energy is higher\r\nand thus temperature is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature rises. Increased energy\r\ndisrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Because these bonds can be created and disrupted rapidly,\r\nwater absorbs an increase in energy and temperature changes only minimally. This means that water moderates\r\ntemperature changes within organisms and in their environments. As energy input continues, the balance between\r\nhydrogen-bond formation and destruction swings toward the destruction side. More bonds are broken than are\r\nformed.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"4877bbee-a8d9-4354-9e1b-5afe67bb8cc4":{"id_":"4877bbee-a8d9-4354-9e1b-5afe67bb8cc4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"UV9kfmjyxKzCnPAAnUjHp4F1j7CJaZNZCB6vGVOgln0=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"mFt/tCrc9K5Do9fA7syKrJu00eJeJMzJE2XnOtHVTZg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3819dfea-529e-4e16-8514-7bb4a28f420d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"L0fHAtuhR7UOZLiVxjzCThQy3FzXx8s8YBV7o9/TCX4="}},"hash":"L/eeIcMma6Ire/NL/Kujm2jWjlu6eEXSXfUxDSfm0B4=","text":"More bonds are broken than are\r\nformed.

Conversely, as molecular motion decreases and temperatures drop, less energy is present to break the hydrogen\r\nbonds between water molecules.

Before it overflows,\r\nthe water actually forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because\r\nof the property ofcohesion. In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen\r\nbonding), keeping the molecules together at the liquid-air (gas) interface, although there is no more room in the\r\nglass. Cohesion gives rise tosurface tension, the capacity of a substance to withstand rupture when placed under\r\ntension or stress. When you drop a small scrap of paper onto a droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water\r\ndroplet, although the object is denser (heavier) than the water. This occurs because of the surface tension that is\r\ncreated by the water molecules. Cohesion and surface tension keep the water molecules intact and the item floating\r\non the top. It is even possible to “float” a steel needle on top of a glass of water if you place it gently, without\r\nbreaking the surface tension (Figure 2.11). FIGURE 2.11The weight of a needle on top of water pulls the surface tension downward; at the same time, the surface tension of the wateris pulling it up, suspending the needle on the surface of the water and keeping it from sinking. Notice the indentation in the water around\r\nthe needle. (credit: Cory Zanker)\r\nThese cohesive forces are also related to the water’s property ofadhesion, or the attraction between water\r\nmolecules and other molecules. This is observed when water “climbs” up a straw placed in a glass of water. You will\r\nnotice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the straw than in the middle. This is because the water\r\nmolecules are attracted to the straw and therefore adhere to it. Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for sustaining life. For example, because of these forces, water can flow\r\nup from the roots to the tops of plants to feed the plant.

The\r\noverall concentration of hydrogen ions is inversely related to its pH and can be measured on thepH scale(Figure\r\n2.12). Therefore, the more hydrogen ions present, the lower the pH; conversely, the fewer hydrogen ions, the higher\r\nthe pH. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A change of one unit on the pH scale represents a change in the concentration of\r\nhydrogen ions by a factor of 10, a change in two units represents a change in the concentration of hydrogen ions by\r\na factor of 100.

There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\r\nnucleic acids), and each is an important component of the cell and performs a wide array of functions. Combined,\r\nthese molecules make up the majority of a cell’s dry mass. Biological macromolecules are organic, meaning they\r\ncontain carbon and are bound to hydrogen, and may contain oxygen, nitrogen, and additional minor elements. Carbon\r\nIt is often said that life is “carbon-based. ” This means that carbon atoms, bonded to other carbon atoms or other\r\nelements, form the fundamental components of many, if not most, of the molecules found uniquely in living things. Other elements play important roles in biological molecules, but carbon certainly qualifies as the “foundation”\r\nelement for molecules in living things. It is the bonding properties of carbon atoms that are responsible for its\r\nimportant role. Carbon Bonding\r\nCarbon contains four electrons in its outer shell. Therefore, it can form four covalent bonds with other atoms or\r\nmolecules. The simplest organic carbon molecule is methane (CH4), in which four hydrogen atoms bind to a carbon\r\natom (Figure 2.13). FIGURE 2.13Carbon can form four covalent bonds to create an organic molecule. The simplest carbon molecule is methane (CH4),depicted here. However, structures that are more complex are made using carbon. Any of the hydrogen atoms can be replaced with\r\nanother carbon atom covalently bonded to the first carbon atom. In this way, long and branching chains of carbon\r\ncompounds can be made (Figure 2.14a). The carbon atoms may bond with atoms of other elements, such as\r\nnitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus (Figure 2.14b). The molecules may also form rings, which themselves can link\r\nwith other rings (Figure 2.14c).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"ba590344-7dbf-4207-b6bf-7293b073ef8b":{"id_":"ba590344-7dbf-4207-b6bf-7293b073ef8b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"xYJsqhWIF2K9yBFeGUokVrSDhpNVCj1hAVQlMHpCj5k=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"OtdqbJ45jRLmgzwAeSBeam9h2cywx6hHtxmko9vuQhY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"beee5cf4-478e-442c-b921-795afea86ebe","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"570sWMn9anWbCjqVSuNU7407x84TWoP0fZOkMS+9sfo="}},"hash":"oi0WvJORcoqTLg8cGM1pbo2Mo+fgcbx3J9qZfZ8VFz4=","text":"This diversity of molecular forms accounts for the diversity of functions of the\r\nbiological macromolecules and is based to a large degree on the ability of carbon to form multiple bonds with itself\r\nand other atoms. 2.3 • Biological Molecules               39","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"920c163e-e100-4a7a-856f-9ede1abbec89":{"id_":"920c163e-e100-4a7a-856f-9ede1abbec89","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"rVrcz2znYB89xPnPZyWsoWZ9rTnZ0XWPf+Ib1e9O7b8=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"V15riPw1IGY0UNaLZee5eUAL4BLnoxJzGequ72sX6nw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7385ccea-66bc-423c-8b76-75b2a42d75d7","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"4QTVwSafjoBaoSa7zuiiEBqT/hZPgj/pDkvTTFhO7Sg="}},"hash":"1ppF8VuiBEorap2hctomdZYfNm/677wWgAfBAUKDh8A=","text":"FIGURE 2.14These examples show three molecules (found in living organisms) that contain carbon atoms bonded in various ways to othercarbon atoms and the atoms of other elements.

This is one of the reasons why registered dietitians are increasingly sought after for\r\nadvice. Registered dietitians help plan food and nutrition programs for individuals in various settings. They often\r\nwork with patients in health-care facilities, designing nutrition plans to prevent and treat diseases. For example,\r\ndietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to manage blood-sugar levels by eating the correct types and\r\namounts of carbohydrates. Dietitians may also work in nursing homes, schools, and private practices. To become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelor’s degree in dietetics, nutrition, food\r\ntechnology, or a related field. In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship program and\r\npass a national exam. Those who pursue careers in dietetics take courses in nutrition, chemistry, biochemistry,\r\nbiology, microbiology, and human physiology. Dietitians must become experts in the chemistry and functions of food\r\n(proteins, carbohydrates, and fats).

This is because they are hydrocarbons that\r\ninclude only nonpolar carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen bonds. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell.

For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the\r\npalm tree. Arachidic acid is derived fromArachis hypogaea, the scientific name for peanuts. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between\r\nneighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is saturated.Saturated fatty acidsare saturated with\r\nhydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. When the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond, the fatty acid is anunsaturated fatty acid. Most unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are calledoils. If there is one double bond in the\r\nmolecule, then it is known as a monounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then\r\nit is known as a polyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil). Saturated fats tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic acid and\r\npalmitic acid contained in meat, and the fat with butyric acid contained in butter, are examples of saturated fats. Mammals store fats in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy most of the cell. In plants,\r\nfat or oil is stored in seeds and is used as a source of energy during embryonic development. Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain unsaturated fatty acids. The double bond causes a\r\nbend or a “kink” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature. Olive\r\noil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats help to improve blood\r\ncholesterol levels, whereas saturated fats might contribute to plaque formation in the arteries, which increases the\r\nrisk of a heart attack.

The functions of proteins are very diverse because there are 20 different chemically distinct amino acids that form\r\nlong chains, and the amino acids can be in any order. For example, proteins can function as enzymes or hormones. Enzymes, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually\r\nproteins.

For example, insulin is a protein hormone that maintains blood glucose levels. Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are\r\nfibrous in nature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is critical to its function. Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to\r\npermanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to a loss of function ordenaturation(to be discussed in\r\nmore detail later). All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 kinds of amino acids. Amino acidsare the monomers that make up proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which\r\nconsists of a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group (–NH2), a carboxyl group (–COOH), and a hydrogen\r\natom. Every amino acid also has another variable atom or group of atoms bonded to the central carbon atom known\r\nas the R group. The R group is the only difference in structure between the 20 amino acids; otherwise, the amino\r\nacids are identical (Figure 2.20). FIGURE 2.20Amino acids are made up of a central carbon bonded to an amino group (–NH2), a carboxyl group (–COOH), and a hydrogenatom. The central carbon’s fourth bond varies among the different amino acids, as seen in these examples of alanine, valine, lysine, and\r\naspartic acid. The chemical nature of the R group determines the chemical nature of the amino acid within its protein (that is,\r\nwhether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar). The sequence and number of amino acids ultimately determine a protein’s shape, size, and function. Each amino\r\nacid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which is formed by a\r\ndehydration reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of a second amino acid combine,\r\nreleasing a water molecule. The resulting bond is the peptide bond.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION\r\nThe Evolutionary Significance of Cytochrome c\r\nCytochrome c is an important component of the molecular machinery that harvests energy from glucose. Because\r\nthis protein’s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years. Protein\r\nsequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of sequence similarity among cytochrome c molecules of\r\ndifferent species; evolutionary relationships can be assessed by measuring the similarities or differences among\r\nvarious species’ protein sequences. For example, scientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino acids. For each cytochrome\r\nc molecule that has been sequenced to date from different organisms, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same\r\nposition in each cytochrome c. This indicates that all of these organisms are descended from a common ancestor. On comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences, no sequence difference was found. When human and\r\nrhesus monkey sequences were compared, a single difference was found in one amino acid. In contrast, human-to-\r\nyeast comparisons show a difference in 44 amino acids, suggesting that humans and chimpanzees have a more\r\nrecent common ancestor than humans and the rhesus monkey, or humans and yeast. Protein Structure\r\nAs discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function. To understand how the protein gets its final\r\nshape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and\r\nquaternary (Figure 2.21). The unique sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. The unique\r\nsequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene that encodes the protein. Any change in the gene\r\nsequence may lead to a different amino acid being added to the polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein\r\nstructure and function.

What is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta\r\nchains that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The\r\nstructural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule—that dramatically\r\ndecreases life expectancy in the affected individuals—is a single amino acid of the 600. Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, the normally biconcave, or disc-shaped, red blood cells\r\nassume a crescent or “sickle” shape, which clogs arteries. This can lead to a myriad of serious health problems,\r\nsuch as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for those who have this disease. Folding patterns resulting from interactions between the non-R group portions of amino acids give rise to the\r\nsecondary structure of the protein. The most common are the alpha (α)-helix and beta (β)-pleated sheet structures. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds. In the alpha helix, the bonds form between every fourth\r\namino acid and cause a twist in the amino acid chain. In the β-pleated sheet, the “pleats” are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of the\r\npolypeptide chain. The R groups are attached to the carbons, and extend above and below the folds of the pleat. The\r\npleated segments align parallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the same pairs of atoms on each\r\nof the aligned amino acids.

Electrons can be donated or shared between\r\natoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and\r\nhydrogen bonds, as well as van der Waals interactions. 2.2Water\r\nWater has many properties that are critical to\r\nmaintaining life. It is polar, allowing for the formation of\r\nhydrogen bonds, which allow ions and other polar\r\nmolecules to dissolve in water. Therefore, water is an\r\nexcellent solvent. The hydrogen bonds between water\r\nmolecules give water the ability to hold heat better\r\nthan many other substances. As the temperature rises,\r\nthe hydrogen bonds between water continually break\r\nand reform, allowing for the overall temperature to\r\nremain stable, although increased energy is added to\r\nthe system. Water’s cohesive forces allow for the\r\nproperty of surface tension. All of these unique\r\nproperties of water are important in the chemistry of\r\nliving organisms. The pH of a solution is a measure of the concentration\r\nof hydrogen ions in the solution. A solution with a high\r\nnumber of hydrogen ions is acidic and has a low pH\r\nvalue. A solution with a high number of hydroxide ions\r\nis basic and has a high pH value. The pH scale ranges\r\nfrom 0 to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral. Buffers are\r\nsolutions that moderate pH changes when an acid or\r\nbase is added to the buffer system. Buffers are\r\nimportant in biological systems because of their ability\r\nto maintain constant pH conditions. 2.3Biological Molecules\r\nLiving things are carbon-based because carbon plays\r\nsuch a prominent role in the chemistry of living things. The four covalent bonding positions of the carbon atom\r\ncan give rise to a wide diversity of compounds with\r\nmany functions, accounting for the importance of\r\n52     2 • Chapter Summary\r\nAccess for free at openstax.org","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e4d15e41-38fc-4125-bddd-e7cd294952c5":{"id_":"e4d15e41-38fc-4125-bddd-e7cd294952c5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"CHRT4i41xTP9m2JcxoeYasYFkTkAV/ORoUXoYrZJJ6A=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"KN6ZmS9ORV8V4rIykXnxqocbiw11udwkxovzvLg7noY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8956f840-6b54-43d0-8228-e46d79be37b2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"Fy0YpSEzCCPjOyCSN6tPoHLUBYtYKSA44+MCXpjvo78="}},"hash":"vpwVyq+dz0OEb7Htih7lzC8VC/ttuuFpUNl2G/8aZwU=","text":"carbon in living things. Carbohydrates are a group of\r\nmacromolecules that are a vital energy source for the\r\ncell, provide structural support to many organisms, and\r\ncan be found on the surface of the cell as receptors or\r\nfor cell recognition. Carbohydrates are classified as\r\nmonosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides,\r\ndepending on the number of monomers in the\r\nmolecule. Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar\r\nand hydrophobic in nature. Major types include fats\r\nand oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats and\r\noils are a stored form of energy and can include\r\ntriglycerides. Fats and oils are usually made up of fatty\r\nacids and glycerol. Proteins are a class of macromolecules that can\r\nperform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They\r\nhelp in metabolism by providing structural support and\r\nby acting as enzymes, carriers or as hormones. The\r\nbuilding blocks of proteins are amino acids. Proteins\r\nare organized at four levels: primary, secondary,\r\ntertiary, and quaternary. Protein shape and function are\r\nintricately linked; any change in shape caused by\r\nchanges in temperature, pH, or chemical exposure may\r\nlead to protein denaturation and a loss of function. Nucleic acids are molecules made up of repeating units\r\nof nucleotides that direct cellular activities such as cell\r\ndivision and protein synthesis.

What is the basic building block of that\r\nwall? It is a single brick, of course. Like a brick wall, your body is composed of basic building\r\nblocks, and the building blocks of your body are cells. Your body has many kinds of cells, each specialized for a specific purpose. Just as a home is made\r\nfrom a variety of building materials, the human body is constructed from many cell types. For\r\nexample, epithelial cells protect the surface of the body and cover the organs and body cavities\r\nwithin. Bone cells help to support and protect the body. Cells of the immune system fight invading\r\nbacteria. Additionally, red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. Each of these cell types\r\nplays a vital role during the growth, development, and day-to-day maintenance of the body. In\r\nspite of their enormous variety, however, all cells share certain fundamental characteristics. 3.1 How Cells Are Studied\r\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\r\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\r\n•Describe the roles of cells in organisms\r\n•Compare and contrast light microscopy and electron microscopy\r\n•Summarize the cell theory\r\nA cell is the smallest unit of a living thing. A living thing, like you, is called an organism. Thus, cells\r\nare the basic building blocks of all organisms.

Before discussing the criteria for\r\ndetermining whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic, let us first examine how biologists study\r\ncells. Microscopy\r\nCells vary in size. With few exceptions, individual cells are too small to be seen with the naked eye,\r\nso scientists use microscopes to study them. Amicroscopeis an instrument that magnifies an\r\nobject. Most images of cells are taken with a microscope and are called micrographs. Light Microscopes\r\nTo give you a sense of the size of a cell, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a\r\nmeter or eight micrometers (abbreviated as μm) in diameter; the head of a pin is about two\r\nthousandths of a meter (millimeters, or mm) in diameter. That means that approximately 250 red\r\nblood cells could fit on the head of a pin. The optics of the lenses of a light microscope changes the orientation of the image. A specimen\r\nthat is right-side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing\r\nleft when viewed through a microscope, and vice versa. Similarly, if the slide is moved left while\r\nlooking through the microscope, it will appear to move right, and if moved down, it will seem to\r\nmove up. This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"a3fd9c4b-d54b-4565-948b-f213868984f9":{"id_":"a3fd9c4b-d54b-4565-948b-f213868984f9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"dn8YZNLV/rHyLoPu0Q/V9KKCp3IfpqlXuIq2my4ii04=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"DwmEla4GpvC0DVeXsDx55piI5ym0qx+HrdKi0eMGOP0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"013f9c4d-6afd-4cbb-8bec-bcc93af09726","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"KsDM0x1dM+h+uVYoqH/4UccjEykkZ5KOhvVX5Qd5utM="}},"hash":"AJqz/IStmFJGFQipRu7E1g8jfsQ4pFbBsInaZBoXKIA=","text":"This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image. Due to\r\nthe manner in which light travels through the lenses, this system of lenses produces an inverted\r\nimage (binoculars and a dissecting microscope work in a similar manner, but include an additional\r\nmagnification system that makes the final image appear to be upright). Most student microscopes are classified as light microscopes (Figure 3.2a). Visible light both\r\npasses through and is bent by the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light\r\nmicroscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but since individual cells are generally\r\ntransparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special stains. Staining, however, usually kills the cells. Light microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to\r\napproximately 400 times. Two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and\r\nresolving power. Magnification is the degree of enlargement of an object. Resolving power is the\r\nability of a microscope to allow the eye to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate; the\r\nhigher the resolution, the closer those two objects can be, and the better the clarity and detail of\r\nthe image. When oil immersion lenses are used, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times\r\nfor the study of smaller cells, like most prokaryotic cells. Because light entering a specimen from\r\nbelow is focused onto the eye of an observer, the specimen can be viewed using light microscopy. For this reason, for light to pass through a specimen, the sample must be thin or translucent.

Thick objects can be examined with many\r\ncomponents in focus at the same time. These microscopes are designed to give a magnified and clear view of tissue\r\nstructure as well as the anatomy of the whole organism. Like light microscopes, most modern dissecting\r\nmicroscopes are also binocular, meaning that they have two separate lens systems, one for each eye. The lens\r\nsystems are separated by a certain distance, and therefore provide a sense of depth in the view of their subject to\r\nmake manipulations by hand easier. Dissecting microscopes also have optics that correct the image so that it\r\nappears as if being seen by the naked eye and not as an inverted image. The light illuminating a sample under a\r\ndissecting microscope typically comes from above the sample, but may also be directed from below. FIGURE 3.2(a) Most light microscopes used in a college biology lab can magnify cells up to approximately 400 times. (b) Dissectingmicroscopes have a lower magnification than light microscopes and are used to examine larger objects, such as tissues. Electron Microscopes\r\nIn contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light. Not only\r\ndoes this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail (Figure 3.3), it also provides higher resolving power. Preparation of a specimen for viewing under an electron microscope will kill it; therefore, live cells cannot be viewed\r\nusing this type of microscopy. In addition, the electron beam moves best in a vacuum, making it impossible to view\r\nliving materials. In a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell’s surface, rendering the\r\ndetails of cell surface characteristics by reflection. Cells and other structures are usually coated with a metal like\r\ngold. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam is transmitted through the cell and provides details\r\nof a cell’s internal structures. As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and\r\nexpensive than are light microscopes. 3.1 • How Cells Are Studied               57","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"058f1560-5e05-4d7f-9f67-3a84b1322e09":{"id_":"058f1560-5e05-4d7f-9f67-3a84b1322e09","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"hL+VqO+xF+23WiNjT9Ma/cUc3dgnWuF0Iy5bc6ipL1o=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"9gQ192o7Z93tzc6YmJckEJTe3KZ9qrrPmFk9mE8pm58="}},"hash":"RNXE4zQY7A8WjCGcDmbb2oJT1RhhcHMo1g/YWQZlZgc=","text":"FIGURE 3.3(a)Salmonellabacteria are viewed with a light microscope.

Despite the limitations of his now-ancient lenses, van\r\nLeeuwenhoek observed the movements of protists (a type of single-celled organism) and sperm, which he\r\ncollectively termed “animalcules. ”\r\nIn a 1665 publication calledMicrographia, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” (from the\r\nLatincella, meaning “small room”) for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens. In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa. Later advances in lenses and microscope\r\nconstruction enabled other scientists to see different components inside cells. By the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed\r\ntheunified cell theory, which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells, that the cell is the\r\nbasic unit of life, and that all new cells arise from existing cells. These principles still stand today. 3.2 Comparing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells\r\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\r\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\r\n•Name examples of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms\r\n•Compare and contrast prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells\r\n•Describe the relative sizes of different kinds of cells\r\nCells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

Unlike Archaea and eukaryotes, bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, comprised of sugars and amino\r\nacids, and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 3.5). The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps\r\nthe cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its\r\nenvironment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion, while most pili are\r\nused to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation. Eukaryotic Cells\r\nIn nature, the relationship between form and function is apparent at all levels, including the level of the cell, and this\r\nwill become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells. The principle “form follows function” is found in many contexts. For example, birds and fish have streamlined bodies that allow them to move quickly through the medium in which\r\nthey live, be it air or water. It means that, in general, one can deduce the function of a structure by looking at its\r\nform, because the two are matched. Aeukaryotic cellis a cell that has a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound compartments or sacs,\r\ncalledorganelles, which have specialized functions. The word eukaryotic means “true kernel” or “true nucleus,”\r\nalluding to the presence of the membrane-bound nucleus in these cells. The word “organelle” means “little organ,”\r\nand, as already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as the organs of your body have\r\nspecialized functions. Cell Size\r\nAt 0.1–5.0 μm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters\r\nranging from 10–100 μm (Figure 3.6). The small size of prokaryotes allows ions and organic molecules that enter\r\nthem to quickly spread to other parts of the cell.

A\r\nphospholipid is a lipid molecule composed of two fatty acid chains, a glycerol backbone, and a phosphate group. The plasma membrane regulates the passage of some substances, such as organic molecules, ions, and water,\r\npreventing the passage of some to maintain internal conditions, while actively bringing in or removing others. Other\r\ncompounds move passively across the membrane. FIGURE 3.8The plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins. There are other components, such as cholesteroland carbohydrates, which can be found in the membrane in addition to phospholipids and protein. The plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption are folded into fingerlike projections called microvilli\r\n(singular = microvillus). This folding increases the surface area of the plasma membrane. Such cells are typically\r\nfound lining the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. This is an excellent example of\r\nform matching the function of a structure. People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune response damages microvilli, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients. This leads to\r\nmalnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet. The Cytoplasm\r\nThecytoplasmcomprises the contents of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (a\r\nstructure to be discussed shortly). It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel-likecytosol, the cytoskeleton,\r\nand various chemicals (Figure 3.7).

When viewed through an electron\r\nmicroscope, free ribosomes appear as either clusters or single tiny dots floating freely in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes\r\nmay be attached to either the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic\r\nreticulum (Figure 3.7). Electron microscopy has shown that ribosomes consist of large and small subunits. Ribosomes are enzyme complexes that are responsible for protein synthesis. Because protein synthesis is essential for all cells, ribosomes are found in practically every cell, although they are\r\nsmaller in prokaryotic cells. They are particularly abundant in immature red blood cells for the synthesis of\r\nhemoglobin, which functions in the transport of oxygen throughout the body. Mitochondria\r\nMitochondria(singular = mitochondrion) are often called the “powerhouses” or “energy factories” of a cell because\r\nthey are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule. The\r\nformation of ATP from the breakdown of glucose is known as cellular respiration. Mitochondria are oval-shaped,\r\ndouble-membrane organelles (Figure 3.14) that have their own ribosomes and DNA. Each membrane is a\r\nphospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The inner layer has folds called cristae, which increase the surface\r\narea of the inner membrane. The area surrounded by the folds is called the mitochondrial matrix. The cristae and\r\nthe matrix have different roles in cellular respiration. In keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to point out that muscle cells have a very high\r\nconcentration of mitochondria because muscle cells need a lot of energy to contract. 68               3 • Cell Structure and Function\r\nAccess for free at openstax.org","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"5f774adc-db06-4afb-a1e7-c2eb1d95e422":{"id_":"5f774adc-db06-4afb-a1e7-c2eb1d95e422","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"WToq4CpKBcWrkRYNMZ6jsT+mA3KhaYcYuUCSVyeIbVw=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"RbrDXPO71+xkr1RDJkixJ4Q51pQKe7OHRK1+t+VL7aY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"99ae74dc-4e48-4618-8c0a-68605824b7f2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"EJhQP0bjIdO+VK60BoK8ClkXOoq2g3IpXsaxt2Exzlg="}},"hash":"WwMfMvPVYiZH/Zwu6OygYE8nSQrsH6zy2rxmrnOhGdg=","text":"FIGURE 3.14This transmission electron micrograph shows a mitochondrion as viewed with an electron microscope.

Thecell wallis a rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Fungal\r\nand protist cells also have cell walls. While the chief component of prokaryotic cell walls is peptidoglycan, the major organic molecule in the plant cell\r\nwall is cellulose, a polysaccharide made up of long, straight chains of glucose units. When nutritional information\r\nrefers to dietary fiber, it is referring to the cellulose content of food. Chloroplasts\r\nLike mitochondria, chloroplasts also have their own DNA and ribosomes.Chloroplastsfunction in photosynthesis\r\nand can be found in eukaryotic cells such as plants and algae. In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide, water, and light\r\nenergy are used to make glucose and oxygen.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"99ae74dc-4e48-4618-8c0a-68605824b7f2":{"id_":"99ae74dc-4e48-4618-8c0a-68605824b7f2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"WToq4CpKBcWrkRYNMZ6jsT+mA3KhaYcYuUCSVyeIbVw=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"RbrDXPO71+xkr1RDJkixJ4Q51pQKe7OHRK1+t+VL7aY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5f774adc-db06-4afb-a1e7-c2eb1d95e422","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"WwMfMvPVYiZH/Zwu6OygYE8nSQrsH6zy2rxmrnOhGdg="}},"hash":"EJhQP0bjIdO+VK60BoK8ClkXOoq2g3IpXsaxt2Exzlg=","text":"This is the major difference between plants and animals: Plants\r\n(autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like glucose, whereas animals (heterotrophs) must rely on other\r\norganisms for their organic compounds or food source.

The chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which captures the energy of sunlight for\r\nphotosynthesis. Like plant cells, photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts. Some bacteria also perform\r\nphotosynthesis, but they do not have chloroplasts. Their photosynthetic pigments are located in the thylakoid\r\nmembrane within the cell itself. EVOLUTION CONNECTION\r\nEndosymbiosis\r\nWe have mentioned that both mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA and ribosomes. Have you wondered why? Strong evidence points to endosymbiosis as the explanation. Symbiosis is a relationship in which organisms from two separate species live in close association and typically\r\nexhibit specific adaptations to each other. Endosymbiosis (endo-= within) is a relationship in which one organism\r\nlives inside the other. Endosymbiotic relationships abound in nature. Microbes that produce vitamin K live inside the\r\nhuman gut. This relationship is beneficial for us because we are unable to synthesize vitamin K. It is also beneficial\r\nfor the microbes because they are protected from other organisms and are provided a stable habitat and abundant\r\nfood by living within the large intestine. Scientists have long noticed that bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are similar in size and have other similar\r\nfeatures. In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists discovered that mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA and\r\nribosomes, just as bacteria do. In 1967, Lynn Margulis used microbial evidence in her proposal of endosymbiotic\r\ntheory, which indicated that these organelles originated from separate organisms. Although Margulis’s work was\r\nmet with resistance, this basic component of this once-revolutionary hypothesis is now widely accepted. Scientists\r\nbelieve that host cells and bacteria formed a mutually beneficial endosymbiotic relationship when the host cells\r\ningested aerobic bacteria and cyanobacteria but did not destroy them. Through evolution, these ingested bacteria\r\nbecame more specialized in their functions, with the aerobic bacteria becoming mitochondria and the\r\nphotosynthetic bacteria becoming chloroplasts.

In plant cells, the liquid inside the\r\ncentral vacuole provides turgor pressure, which is the outward pressure caused by the fluid inside the cell.

As the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves the cell wall unsupported. This loss of support\r\nto the cell walls of a plant results in the wilted appearance.

Extracellular Matrix of Animal Cells\r\nMost animal cells release materials into the extracellular space. The primary components of these materials are\r\nglycoproteins and the protein collagen. Collectively, these materials are called theextracellular matrix(Figure\r\n3.16). Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue, but it also allows the cells\r\nwithin the tissue to communicate with each other. FIGURE 3.16The extracellular matrix consists of a network of substances secreted by cells. Blood clotting provides an example of the role of the extracellular matrix in cell communication. When the cells\r\nlining a blood vessel are damaged, they display a protein receptor called tissue factor. When tissue factor binds with\r\nanother factor in the extracellular matrix, it causes platelets to adhere to the wall of the damaged blood vessel,\r\nstimulates adjacent smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel to contract (thus constricting the blood vessel), and\r\ninitiates a series of steps that stimulate the platelets to produce clotting factors.

There are some\r\ndifferences in the ways that plant and animal cells do this.Plasmodesmata(singular = plasmodesma) are junctions\r\nbetween plant cells, whereas animal cell contacts include tight and gap junctions, and desmosomes. In general, long stretches of the plasma membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another because\r\nthey are separated by the cell walls surrounding each cell. Plasmodesmata are numerous channels that pass\r\nbetween the cell walls of adjacent plant cells, connecting their cytoplasm and enabling signal molecules and\r\nnutrients to be transported from cell to cell (Figure 3.17a). 3.3 • Eukaryotic Cells               71","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"1ae4bedf-9c6c-4e93-a0ec-f56007aa045b":{"id_":"1ae4bedf-9c6c-4e93-a0ec-f56007aa045b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"RsS4gf/HmLMxeIrvwrleR2F+FbecI1X+f/TOTjV1yqU=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"paPsGUsqzwtaLQRbUcVvFY7Y4oLH0669NOcplI33QXo="}},"hash":"ILEg0fWpcweoTTUvreoCaWrP7Fwd9h3+edr0hk7L3YA=","text":"FIGURE 3.17There are four kinds of connections between cells.

Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in controlled quantities. Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly\r\nin flux. The plasma membrane must be sufficiently flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white\r\nblood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more obvious functions of a\r\nplasma membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize\r\none another, which is vital as tissues and organs form during early development, and which later plays a role in the\r\n“self” versus “non-self” distinction of the immune response. The plasma membrane also carries receptors, which are attachment sites for specific substances that interact with\r\nthe cell. Each receptor is structured to bind with a specific substance. For example, surface receptors of the\r\nmembrane create changes in the interior, such as changes in enzymes of metabolic pathways. These metabolic\r\npathways might be vital for providing the cell with energy, making specific substances for the cell, or breaking down\r\ncellular waste or toxins for disposal.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"fe778e12-01af-40ee-aedf-e8daaeb9b359":{"id_":"fe778e12-01af-40ee-aedf-e8daaeb9b359","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"JsHiY9isWkuN7MYzj9zQ8JGeA3IMkMD3kRLTTkEyRQY=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"vAtqIFsqLc19Advjfs7o3A6dt3ieCBwuDq3AuGhsei0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"59821814-c74a-4392-a700-fffe45bc3de4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"gb/1kbhZZuKw8l9Q8LMNBcC0Bj6tB33JKloKFVZDo00="}},"hash":"YlEsE3PggvKLVAR0ySyMeIFKoRf8YjTXLOhgp9v9LBU=","text":"Receptors on the plasma membrane’s exterior surface interact with hormones\r\nor neurotransmitters, and allow their messages to be transmitted into the cell.

The fluid mosaic model describes\r\nthe structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components—including phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins,\r\nand carbohydrates—in which the components are able to flow and change position, while maintaining the basic\r\nintegrity of the membrane. Both phospholipid molecules and embedded proteins are able to diffuse rapidly and\r\nlaterally in the membrane. The fluidity of the plasma membrane is necessary for the activities of certain enzymes\r\nand transport molecules within the membrane. Plasma membranes range from 5–10 nm thick. As a comparison,\r\nhuman red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 μm thick, or approximately 1,000 times\r\nthicker than a plasma membrane. (Figure 3.18)\r\nFIGURE 3.18The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane structure describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination ofphospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates. The plasma membrane is made up primarily of a bilayer of phospholipids with embedded proteins, carbohydrates,\r\nglycolipids, and glycoproteins, and, in animal cells, cholesterol. The amount of cholesterol in animal plasma\r\nmembranes regulates the fluidity of the membrane and changes based on the temperature of the cell’s\r\nenvironment. In other words, cholesterol acts as antifreeze in the cell membrane and is more abundant in animals\r\nthat live in cold climates. The main fabric of the membrane is composed of two layers of phospholipid molecules, and the polar ends of these\r\nmolecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist’s rendition of the model) (Figure 3.18) are in contact with\r\naqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell. Thus, both surfaces of the plasma membrane are hydrophilic. In\r\ncontrast, the interior of the membrane, between its two surfaces, is a hydrophobic or nonpolar region because of the\r\nfatty acid tails. This region has no attraction for water or other polar molecules. Proteins make up the second major chemical component of plasma membranes. Integral proteins are embedded in\r\nthe plasma membrane and may span all or part of the membrane.

The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive.Passive transportis a naturally occurring phenomenon\r\nand does not require the cell to expend energy to accomplish the movement.

Some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular weight material, such as ions,\r\nthrough the membrane.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"eb634865-bf36-48ce-ad34-c89f6451bf82":{"id_":"eb634865-bf36-48ce-ad34-c89f6451bf82","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"7CfOQRB3XpyDSaCC6dm87dPn/nu+HEbXOdbrerI9onU=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"SoKphCbF273oebQ5MOccJfCPmIBGBeCl3Y9+rNDiKUg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f366f9aa-95c0-4eef-be1c-c7c4c2638037","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"WbJFTyVOKgnug0fm+edRTs/w0oUJnGwskjTlp8OCIgE="}},"hash":"EXsAjM4bEx3PSWGrwAjRExWH/dwUNsbR2/OY/6KZsjw=","text":"Some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular weight material, such as ions,\r\nthrough the membrane. 80               3 • Cell Structure and Function\r\nAccess for free at openstax.org","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"f46a033e-4fb0-4f19-ae6f-1b064fca65b1":{"id_":"f46a033e-4fb0-4f19-ae6f-1b064fca65b1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"q5QkEfN6SnMp9Dbtri/TFZrTBJXpMZ5Jol4Smt07kpw=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"kgB0tyNnJyG9o+/JcwmuBe1d3n2EGQQ+oDPsIQcTluk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b4224322-6a5b-49cd-848f-966901fe9fd3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"rs0MznM77d6tCnnph88IOFfUmMQ/pt6xLXv25Ojf1qk="}},"hash":"sIca5ldcwfdXw5xbFTMYW77AEiRhArVrnqD07Ldh7a0=","text":"In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger\r\nmolecules and particles. Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular microorganisms. You might have\r\ncorrectly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires energy. A large particle,\r\nhowever, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell. Electrochemical Gradient\r\nWe have discussed simple concentration gradients—differential concentrations of a substance across a space or a\r\nmembrane—but in living systems, gradients are more complex. Because cells contain proteins, most of which are\r\nnegatively charged, and because ions move into and out of cells, there is an electrical gradient, a difference of\r\ncharge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the\r\nextracellular fluid in which they are bathed; at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K+)\r\nand lower concentrations of sodium (Na+) than does the extracellular fluid. Thus, in a living cell, the concentration\r\ngradient and electrical gradient of Na+promotes diffusion of the ion into the cell, and the electrical gradient of Na+\r\n(a positive ion) tends to drive it inward to the negatively charged interior. The situation is more complex, however, for\r\nother elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of K+promotes diffusion of the ionintothe cell, but the\r\nconcentration gradient of K+promotes diffusionoutof the cell (Figure 3.24). The combined gradient that affects an\r\nion is called itselectrochemical gradient, and it is especially important to muscle and nerve cells. FIGURE 3.24Electrochemical gradients arise from the combined effects of concentration gradients and electrical gradients. Na+ions are athigher concentration outside the cell, and K+ions are at higher concentration inside of the cell, and yet the inside of the cell has negative\r\nnet charge compared to the other side of the membrane. This is due to the presence of K+binding proteins and other negatively chargedmolecules. The difference in electrical charges attracts the positively charged Na ions toward the inside of the cell, the electrical gradient,\r\nwhile the K ions tend to flow through K channels toward the outside of the cell due to the concentration difference, the concentrationgradient.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"b4224322-6a5b-49cd-848f-966901fe9fd3":{"id_":"b4224322-6a5b-49cd-848f-966901fe9fd3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"q5QkEfN6SnMp9Dbtri/TFZrTBJXpMZ5Jol4Smt07kpw=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"kgB0tyNnJyG9o+/JcwmuBe1d3n2EGQQ+oDPsIQcTluk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f46a033e-4fb0-4f19-ae6f-1b064fca65b1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"sIca5ldcwfdXw5xbFTMYW77AEiRhArVrnqD07Ldh7a0="}},"hash":"rs0MznM77d6tCnnph88IOFfUmMQ/pt6xLXv25Ojf1qk=","text":"(credit: modification of work by “Synaptitude”/Wikimedia Commons)\r\nMoving Against a Gradient\r\nTo move substances against a concentration or an electrochemical gradient, the cell must use energy. This energy is\r\nharvested from ATP that is generated through cellular metabolism. Active transport mechanisms, collectively called\r\npumps or carrier proteins, work against electrochemical gradients. With the exception of ions, small substances\r\nconstantly pass through plasma membranes. Active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other\r\nsubstances needed by living cells in the face of these passive changes. Much of a cell’s supply of metabolic energy\r\nmay be spent maintaining these processes. Because active transport mechanisms depend on cellular metabolism\r\nfor energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the supply of ATP. Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small-molecular weight material and macromolecules. Primary active\r\ntransport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane.

Endocytosis\r\nEndocytosisis a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even\r\nwhole cells, into a cell. There are different variations of endocytosis, but all share a common characteristic: The\r\nplasma membrane of the cell invaginates, forming a pocket around the target particle. The pocket pinches off,\r\nresulting in the particle being contained in a newly created vacuole that is formed from the plasma membrane. FIGURE 3.26Three variations of endocytosis are shown. (a) In one form of endocytosis, phagocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds theparticle and pinches off to form an intracellular vacuole. (b) In another type of endocytosis, pinocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds a\r\nsmall volume of fluid and pinches off, forming a vesicle. (c) In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the cell is targetedto a single type of substance that binds at the receptor on the external cell membrane.

A variation of endocytosis is calledpinocytosis. This literally means “cell drinking” and was named at a time when\r\nthe assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this process takes in\r\nsolutes that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid (Figure 3.26). A targeted variation of endocytosis employs binding proteins in the plasma membrane that are specific for certain\r\nsubstances (Figure 3.26). The particles bind to the proteins and the plasma membrane invaginates, bringing the\r\nsubstance and the proteins into the cell. If passage across the membrane of the target ofreceptor-mediated\r\nendocytosisis ineffective, it will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids\r\nand increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by a failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For\r\nexample, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is\r\nremoved from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial\r\nhypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-\r\nthreatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear the chemical from their blood.

A\r\nparticle enveloped in membrane fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane. This fusion opens the\r\nmembranous envelope to the exterior of the cell, and the particle is expelled into the extracellular space (Figure\r\n3.27).

Most cells are so small\r\nthat they cannot be viewed with the naked eye. Therefore, scientists must use microscopes to study\r\ncells. Electron microscopes provide higher\r\nmagnification, higher resolution, and more detail than\r\nlight microscopes.

All prokaryotes\r\nhave plasma membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, a cell\r\nwall, DNA, and lack membrane-bound organelles. Many also have polysaccharide capsules. Prokaryotic\r\ncells range in diameter from 0.1–5.0 μm. Like a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma\r\nmembrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a\r\neukaryotic cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell,\r\nhas a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded by a\r\nmembrane), and has other membrane-bound\r\norganelles that allow for compartmentalization of\r\nfunctions. Eukaryotic cells tend to be 10 to 100 times\r\nthe size of prokaryotic cells. 3.3Eukaryotic Cells\r\nLike a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma\r\nmembrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a\r\n3 • Chapter Summary     85","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"11932a58-dcf5-4b83-88ad-8a94cb07b792":{"id_":"11932a58-dcf5-4b83-88ad-8a94cb07b792","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"hudF2hJvFRzwuC8mJNswyD+clUQx00D984o78fj2Kr8=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"/2AQzSbIbPp5g7AXmqu3EJw9QsJ22boDiJaqOY/iyrA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ebdf3f65-c173-4213-9dcb-a3e112941300","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"etcNCwI0fhuewnha1d9NFp0giKCNY3bFePjkMR2LHpM="}},"hash":"MAxsJvB/7hA0PxK4DtVM9hytZgmRRSd+1O1BdkUks+s=","text":"eukaryotic cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell,\r\nhas a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded by a\r\nmembrane), and has other membrane-bound\r\norganelles that allow for compartmentalization of\r\nfunctions. The plasma membrane is a phospholipid\r\nbilayer embedded with proteins. The nucleolus within\r\nthe nucleus is the site for ribosome assembly. Ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm or are attached\r\nto the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or\r\nendoplasmic reticulum. They perform protein\r\nsynthesis. Mitochondria perform cellular respiration\r\nand produce ATP. Peroxisomes break down fatty acids,\r\namino acids, and some toxins. Vesicles and vacuoles\r\nare storage and transport compartments. In plant cells,\r\nvacuoles also help break down macromolecules. Animal cells also have a centrosome and lysosomes. The centrosome has two bodies, the centrioles, with an\r\nunknown role in cell division. Lysosomes are the\r\ndigestive organelles of animal cells. Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a central\r\nvacuole. The plant cell wall, whose primary component\r\nis cellulose, protects the cell, provides structural\r\nsupport, and gives shape to the cell. Photosynthesis\r\ntakes place in chloroplasts. The central vacuole\r\nexpands, enlarging the cell without the need to\r\nproduce more cytoplasm.

The plasma\r\nmembrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids,\r\nwith their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with\r\neach other. The landscape of the membrane is studded\r\nwith proteins, some of which span the membrane. Some of these proteins serve to transport materials\r\ninto or out of the cell. Carbohydrates are attached to\r\nsome of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing\r\nsurface of the membrane. These form complexes that\r\nfunction to identify the cell to other cells. The fluid\r\nnature of the membrane owes itself to the\r\nconfiguration of the fatty acid tails, the presence of\r\ncholesterol embedded in the membrane (in animal\r\ncells), and the mosaic nature of the proteins and\r\nprotein-carbohydrate complexes, which are not firmly\r\nfixed in place.

In\r\nsolutions of more than one substance, each type of\r\nmolecule diffuses according to its own concentration\r\ngradient. Many factors can affect the rate of diffusion,\r\nincluding concentration gradient, the sizes of the\r\nparticles that are diffusing, and the temperature of the\r\nsystem. In living systems, diffusion of substances into and out\r\nof cells is mediated by the plasma membrane. Some\r\nmaterials diffuse readily through the membrane, but\r\nothers are hindered, and their passage is only made\r\npossible by protein channels and carriers. The\r\nchemistry of living things occurs in aqueous solutions,\r\nand balancing the concentrations of those solutions is\r\nan ongoing problem.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"15096e75-47ed-462c-9706-67f6d4b36f00":{"id_":"15096e75-47ed-462c-9706-67f6d4b36f00","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"hudF2hJvFRzwuC8mJNswyD+clUQx00D984o78fj2Kr8=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"/2AQzSbIbPp5g7AXmqu3EJw9QsJ22boDiJaqOY/iyrA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ebdf3f65-c173-4213-9dcb-a3e112941300","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"etcNCwI0fhuewnha1d9NFp0giKCNY3bFePjkMR2LHpM="}},"hash":"HepQylXGK0OVxWXn4fv1nI1vlrpqCshv2i7fL+zteuQ=","text":"In living systems, diffusion of\r\nsome substances would be slow or difficult without\r\nmembrane proteins. 3.6Active Transport\r\nThe combined gradient that affects an ion includes its\r\nconcentration gradient and its electrical gradient.

Energy is\r\nneeded to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use energy while thinking, and even\r\nduring sleep. In fact, the living cells of every organism constantly use energy. Nutrients and other\r\nmolecules are imported into the cell, metabolized (broken down) and possibly synthesized into\r\nnew molecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and possibly distributed to the\r\nentire organism. For example, the large proteins that make up muscles are built from smaller\r\nmolecules imported from dietary amino acids. Complex carbohydrates are broken down into\r\nsimple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a\r\nbuilding, energy is required for the synthesis and breakdown of molecules as well as the transport\r\nof molecules into and out of cells. In addition, processes such as ingesting and breaking down\r\npathogenic bacteria and viruses, exporting wastes and toxins, and movement of the cell require\r\nenergy. From where, and in what form, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain energy,\r\nand how do they use it? This chapter will discuss different forms of energy and the physical laws\r\nthat govern energy transfer. This chapter will also describe how cells use energy and replenish it,\r\nFIGURE 4.1A hummingbird needs energy to maintain prolonged flight.

Cellular processes such as the building and breaking down of\r\ncomplex molecules occur through stepwise chemical reactions. Some of these chemical reactions\r\nare spontaneous and release energy, whereas others require energy to proceed. Just as living\r\nthings must continually consume food to replenish their energy supplies, cells must continually\r\nobtain more energy to replenish that used by the many energy-requiring chemical reactions that\r\nconstantly take place. Together, all of the chemical reactions that take place inside cells, including\r\nthose that consume or generate energy, are referred to as the cell’smetabolism. FIGURE 4.2Ultimately, most life forms get their energy from the sun. Plants use photosynthesis to capture sunlight,and herbivores eat the plants to obtain energy. Carnivores eat the herbivores, and eventual decomposition of plant\r\nand animal material contributes to the nutrient pool. Metabolic Pathways\r\nConsider the metabolism of sugar. This is a classic example of one of the many cellular processes\r\nthat use and produce energy. Living things consume sugars as a major energy source, because\r\nsugar molecules have a great deal of energy stored within their bonds. For the most part,\r\nphotosynthesizing organisms like plants produce these sugars. During photosynthesis, plants use\r\nenergy (originally from sunlight) to convert carbon dioxide gas (CO2) into sugar molecules (like\r\n90               4 • How Cells Obtain Energy\r\nAccess for free at openstax.org","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"72390da3-8105-4fe1-83bb-501ecb9d7eab":{"id_":"72390da3-8105-4fe1-83bb-501ecb9d7eab","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"wSFu+wE0Doa9dJToId8Y1QnDVp+rGfpls677xAuc7pY=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"drKAWP6XwhIm20XONu8K+xJVjEaQcf3kYGhd7q5dVgE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4e0b9b18-2f46-4aa7-832e-b5d513a1d939","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"TQNXwRmgnUww1X2UllDrgOsUIXz9jeGYtAzRUSgvdbQ="}},"hash":"x06n8H/jrW7i2BV7AjcmjYKGsL16x6mRCkWl5VcQBSw=","text":"glucose: C6H12O6).

A\r\nmetabolic pathway is a series of chemical reactions that takes a starting molecule and modifies it, step-by-step,\r\nthrough a series of metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product. In the example of sugar metabolism,\r\nthe first metabolic pathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pathway broke sugar down\r\ninto smaller molecules. These two opposite processes—the first requiring energy and the second producing\r\nenergy—are referred to asanabolicpathways (building polymers) andcatabolicpathways (breaking down polymers\r\ninto their monomers), respectively. Consequently, metabolism is composed of synthesis (anabolism) and\r\ndegradation (catabolism) (Figure 4.3). It is important to know that the chemical reactions of metabolic pathways do not take place on their own. Each\r\nreaction step is facilitated, or catalyzed, by a protein called an enzyme. Enzymes are important for catalyzing all\r\ntypes of biological reactions—those that require energy as well as those that release energy.

According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may be transferred from place\r\nto place or transformed into different forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The transfers and\r\ntransformations of energy take place around us all the time. Light bulbs transform electrical energy into light and\r\nheat energy.

However, the\r\nsecond law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. All energy transfers and\r\ntransformations are never completely efficient. In every energy transfer, some amount of energy is lost in a form that\r\nis unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy. Thermodynamically,heat energyis defined as the energy\r\ntransferred from one system to another that is not work. For example, when a light bulb is turned on, some of the\r\nenergy being converted from electrical energy into light energy is lost as heat energy. Likewise, some energy is lost\r\nas heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions. An important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder. The more energy that is lost by a system to\r\nits surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system is. Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or\r\ndisorder within a system as entropy. High entropy means high disorder and low energy. Molecules and chemical\r\nreactions have varying entropy as well. For example, entropy increases as molecules at a high concentration in one\r\nplace diffuse and spread out. The second law of thermodynamics says that energy will always be lost as heat in\r\nenergy transfers or transformations. Living things are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to be maintained in a state of low entropy. Potential and Kinetic Energy\r\nWhen an object is in motion, there is energy associated with that object. Think of a wrecking ball. Even a slow-\r\nmoving wrecking ball can do a great deal of damage to other objects. Energy associated with objects in motion is\r\ncalledkinetic energy(Figure 4.5).

How can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another reaction? A measurement of free\r\nenergy is used to quantify these energy transfers. Recall that according to the second law of thermodynamics, all\r\nenergy transfers involve the loss of some amount of energy in an unusable form such as heat. Free energy\r\nspecifically refers to the energy associated with a chemical reaction that is available after the losses are accounted\r\nfor. In other words, free energy is usable energy, or energy that is available to do work. If energy is released during a chemical reaction, then the change in free energy, signified as ∆G (delta G) will be a\r\nnegative number. A negative change in free energy also means that the products of the reaction have less free\r\nenergy than the reactants, because they release some free energy during the reaction. Reactions that have a\r\nnegative change in free energy and consequently release free energy are calledexergonic reactions. Think:\r\nexergonic means energy isexiting the system. These reactions are also referred to as spontaneous reactions, and\r\ntheir products have less stored energy than the reactants. An important distinction must be drawn between the\r\nterm spontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction occurring immediately. Contrary to the everyday use of the\r\nterm, a spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"50161e88-b825-4592-9b77-d37fb675cab5":{"id_":"50161e88-b825-4592-9b77-d37fb675cab5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"3dfX60OLKHElI9gg/6VchlE6qiHYjbgq9DirPp1XUbg=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"UYbXCYLsXcNJ3cBHTn2DS+4ug7ChvP4ZsBmoMK8pLm4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"720d92a8-9bc5-4402-b37e-195d19e0722a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"d69KunWgn9gZ6bbuNQYzpcBawWYJmuIT5n1/oazTkZU="}},"hash":"rcymk9ZGiWZ2pY0SMaZvpfBtyqWaOl0Baxuffiv6dNY=","text":"The rusting of iron is an example of a\r\nspontaneous reaction that occurs slowly, little by little, over time.

Enzymes do this by binding to the reactant molecules and holding them in such a way as to make the\r\nchemical bond-breaking and -forming processes take place more easily. It is important to remember that enzymes\r\ndo not change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or endergonic. This is because they do not change the\r\nfree energy of the reactants or products. They only reduce the activation energy required for the reaction to go\r\nforward (Figure 4.7). In addition, an enzyme itself is unchanged by the reaction it catalyzes. Once one reaction has\r\nbeen catalyzed, the enzyme is able to participate in other reactions. FIGURE 4.7Enzymes lower the activation energy of the reaction but do not change the free energy of the reaction. The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are called the enzyme’ssubstrates. There may be one or more\r\nsubstrates, depending on the particular chemical reaction. In some reactions, a single reactant substrate is broken\r\ndown into multiple products. In others, two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule. Two\r\nreactants might also enter a reaction and both become modified, but they leave the reaction as two products. The\r\nlocation within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzyme’sactive site. The active site is where the\r\n“action” happens. Since enzymes are proteins, there is a unique combination of amino acid side chains within the\r\nactive site. Each side chain is characterized by different properties. They can be large or small, weakly acidic or\r\nbasic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, positively or negatively charged, or neutral. The unique combination of side\r\nchains creates a very specific chemical environment within the active site. This specific environment is suited to\r\nbind to one specific chemical substrate (or substrates). Active sites are subject to influences of the local environment.

This complex lowers the activation\r\nenergy of the reaction and promotes its rapid progression in one of multiple possible ways. On a basic level,\r\nenzymes promote chemical reactions that involve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an\r\noptimal orientation for reaction. Another way in which enzymes promote the reaction of their substrates is by\r\ncreating an optimal environment within the active site for the reaction to occur. The chemical properties that emerge\r\nfrom the particular arrangement of amino acid R groups within an active site create the perfect environment for an\r\nenzyme’s specific substrates to react. The enzyme-substrate complex can also lower activation energy by compromising the bond structure so that it is\r\neasier to break. Finally, enzymes can also lower activation energies by taking part in the chemical reaction itself. In\r\nthese cases, it is important to remember that the enzyme will always return to its original state by the completion of\r\nthe reaction. One of the hallmark properties of enzymes is that they remain ultimately unchanged by the reactions\r\nthey catalyze. After an enzyme has catalyzed a reaction, it releases its product(s) and can catalyze a new reaction. FIGURE 4.8The induced-fit model is an adjustment to the lock-and-key model and explains how enzymes and substrates undergo dynamicmodifications during the transition state to increase the affinity of the substrate for the active site. It would seem ideal to have a scenario in which all of an organism's enzymes existed in abundant supply and\r\nfunctioned optimally under all cellular conditions, in all cells, at all times. However, a variety of mechanisms ensures\r\nthat this does not happen. Cellular needs and conditions constantly vary from cell to cell, and change within\r\nindividual cells over time. The required enzymes of stomach cells differ from those of fat storage cells, skin cells,\r\nblood cells, and nerve cells. Furthermore, a digestive organ cell works much harder to process and break down\r\nnutrients during the time that closely follows a meal compared with many hours after a meal. As these cellular\r\ndemands and conditions vary, so must the amounts and functionality of different enzymes. Since the rates of biochemical reactions are controlled by activation energy, and enzymes lower and determine\r\nactivation energies for chemical reactions, the relative amounts and functioning of the variety of enzymes within a\r\ncell ultimately determine which reactions will proceed and at what rates.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"117a5f3b-2c54-459f-9766-07f851c62f1c":{"id_":"117a5f3b-2c54-459f-9766-07f851c62f1c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"zD3ivZ0eUwhZcXPs9vw1E6tdCRJhrQlm5cFSr5P0/nk=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"HdGLGnrujKtOzGpU72S9yuw4wWVrCIGxMIrkp7GqIr4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fd9ce3b5-9510-4cdb-8d22-1417397497b9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"uplTpJAKn+cxnBaz6MEneT5ZtLWRFRy1it7lCN05FjI="}},"hash":"t/qOYT9GsOnWhxrSGG06LCFB1ZHEIcyIWF0LIaU2AzY=","text":"This determination is tightly controlled in\r\ncells.

CAREER CONNECTION\r\nPharmaceutical Drug Developer\r\nFIGURE 4.10Have you ever wondered how pharmaceutical drugs are developed? (credit: Deborah Austin)\r\nEnzymes are key components of metabolic pathways. Understanding how enzymes work and how they can be\r\nregulated are key principles behind the development of many of the pharmaceutical drugs on the market today. Biologists working in this field collaborate with other scientists to design drugs (Figure 4.10). Consider statins for example—statins is the name given to one class of drugs that can reduce cholesterol levels. These compounds are inhibitors of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is the enzyme that synthesizes\r\ncholesterol from lipids in the body. By inhibiting this enzyme, the level of cholesterol synthesized in the body can be\r\nreduced. Similarly, acetaminophen, popularly marketed under the brand name Tylenol, is an inhibitor of the enzyme\r\ncyclooxygenase. While it is used to provide relief from fever and inflammation (pain), its mechanism of action is still\r\nnot completely understood. How are drugs discovered? One of the biggest challenges in drug discovery is identifying a drug target. A drug target\r\nis a molecule that is literally the target of the drug. In the case of statins, HMG-CoA reductase is the drug target. Drug targets are identified through painstaking research in the laboratory. Identifying the target alone is not enough;\r\n98               4 • How Cells Obtain Energy\r\nAccess for free at openstax.org","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"49b4b8b9-c49d-4300-a3ed-c9d029cfe0db":{"id_":"49b4b8b9-c49d-4300-a3ed-c9d029cfe0db","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"dlvo3ytU2/N/EoVHpFWvp4Hs0mJtRIlMxM/c4YJdv4I=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"3JNJWXBjkU9O9ljA82jc1YzePCld+A5JAiY1cVePCuE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0e6d5aac-038d-4688-9d5d-836667b36529","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"40TNdoHy0d1VIzeHqfw8HVYDDRVMx0VWa2UG2SOew/k="}},"hash":"d2Iax3zCIL6E3+I4yywSiYLSt6wl86yF3gIK8BxU4cg=","text":"scientists also need to know how the target acts inside the cell and which reactions go awry in the case of disease. Once the target and the pathway are identified, then the actual process of drug design begins. In this stage,\r\nchemists and biologists work together to design and synthesize molecules that can block or activate a particular\r\nreaction. However, this is only the beginning: If and when a drug prototype is successful in performing its function,\r\nthen it is subjected to many tests from in vitro experiments to clinical trials before it can get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be on the market. Many enzymes do not work optimally, or even at all, unless bound to other specific non-protein helper molecules. They may bond either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds, or permanently through stronger covalent\r\nbonds. Binding to these molecules promotes optimal shape and function of their respective enzymes. Two examples\r\nof these types of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes. Cofactors are inorganic ions such as ions of iron\r\nand magnesium. Coenzymes are organic helper molecules, those with a basic atomic structure made up of carbon\r\nand hydrogen. Like enzymes, these molecules participate in reactions without being changed themselves and are\r\nultimately recycled and reused. Vitamins are the source of coenzymes. Some vitamins are the precursors of\r\ncoenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes. Vitamin C is a direct coenzyme for multiple enzymes that take part\r\nin building the important connective tissue, collagen. Therefore, enzyme function is, in part, regulated by the\r\nabundance of various cofactors and coenzymes, which may be supplied by an organism’s diet or, in some cases,\r\nproduced by the organism. Feedback Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways\r\nMolecules can regulate enzyme function in many ways. The major question remains, however: What are these\r\nmolecules and where do they come from? Some are cofactors and coenzymes, as you have learned. What other\r\nmolecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation such as allosteric modulation, and competitive and non-\r\ncompetitive inhibition? Perhaps the most relevant sources of regulatory molecules, with respect to enzymatic\r\ncellular metabolism, are the products of the cellular metabolic reactions themselves.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"0e6d5aac-038d-4688-9d5d-836667b36529":{"id_":"0e6d5aac-038d-4688-9d5d-836667b36529","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"dlvo3ytU2/N/EoVHpFWvp4Hs0mJtRIlMxM/c4YJdv4I=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"3JNJWXBjkU9O9ljA82jc1YzePCld+A5JAiY1cVePCuE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"49b4b8b9-c49d-4300-a3ed-c9d029cfe0db","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"d2Iax3zCIL6E3+I4yywSiYLSt6wl86yF3gIK8BxU4cg="}},"hash":"40TNdoHy0d1VIzeHqfw8HVYDDRVMx0VWa2UG2SOew/k=","text":"In a most efficient and elegant\r\nway, cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity.

Most of the ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose, however, is not generated directly from\r\nthese pathways. Rather, it derives from a process that begins with passing electrons through a series of chemical\r\nreactions to a final electron acceptor, oxygen. These reactions take place in specialized protein complexes located in\r\nthe inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic organisms and on the inner part of the cell membrane of\r\nprokaryotic organisms. The energy of the electrons is harvested and used to generate an electrochemical gradient\r\nacross the inner mitochondrial membrane. The potential energy of this gradient is used to generate ATP. The entirety\r\nof this process is calledoxidative phosphorylation. The electron transport chain (Figure 4.15a) is the last component of aerobic respiration and is the only part of\r\nmetabolism that uses atmospheric oxygen. Oxygen continuously diffuses into plants for this purpose. In animals,\r\noxygen enters the body through the respiratory system. Electron transport is a series of chemical reactions that\r\nresembles a bucket brigade in that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the next, to the endpoint of\r\nthe chain where oxygen is the final electron acceptor and water is produced.

The uneven distribution of H+ions across the membrane establishes an electrochemical\r\ngradient, owing to the H+ions’ positive charge and their higher concentration on one side of the membrane. Hydrogen ions diffuse through the inner membrane through an integral membrane protein calledATP synthase\r\n(Figure 4.15b). This complex protein acts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing\r\nthrough it, down their electrochemical gradient from the intermembrane space, where there are many mutually\r\nrepelling hydrogen ions to the matrix, where there are few. The turning of the parts of this molecular machine\r\nregenerate ATP from ADP. This flow of hydrogen ions across the membrane through ATP synthase is called\r\nchemiosmosis. Chemiosmosis (Figure 4.15c) is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during aerobic glucose catabolism. The result of the reactions is the production of ATP from the energy of the electrons removed from hydrogen atoms. These atoms were originally part of a glucose molecule. At the end of the electron transport system, the electrons\r\nare used to reduce an oxygen molecule to oxygen ions.

Another source of variance stems from the shuttle of electrons across the mitochondrial membrane. The\r\nNADH generated from glycolysis cannot easily enter mitochondria. Thus, electrons are picked up on the inside of the\r\nmitochondria by either NAD+or FAD+. Fewer ATP molecules are generated when FAD+acts as a carrier. NAD+is\r\nused as the electron transporter in the liver and FAD+in the brain, so ATP yield depends on the tissue being\r\nconsidered.

CAREER CONNECTION\r\nMitochondrial Disease Physician\r\nWhat happens when the critical reactions of cellular respiration do not proceed correctly? Mitochondrial diseases\r\nare genetic disorders of metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders can arise from mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial\r\nDNA, and they result in the production of less energy than is normal in body cells. Symptoms of mitochondrial\r\ndiseases can include muscle weakness, lack of coordination, stroke-like episodes, and loss of vision and hearing. Most affected people are diagnosed in childhood, although there are some adult-onset diseases. Identifying and\r\ntreating mitochondrial disorders is a specialized medical field. The educational preparation for this profession\r\nrequires a college education, followed by medical school with a specialization in medical genetics. Medical\r\ngeneticists can be board certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and go on to become associated with\r\nprofessional organizations devoted to the study of mitochondrial disease, such as the Mitochondrial Medicine\r\nSociety and the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disease. 104               4 • How Cells Obtain Energy\r\nAccess for free at openstax.org","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e89547fc-8bd0-4003-bc38-6e19c7d0240d":{"id_":"e89547fc-8bd0-4003-bc38-6e19c7d0240d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ajcNiJjkty8jNhEtALXgpK57+hiV4dSDaxAUSDCLUas=","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"C20K3KkzX0Dq5uy0I9L0LTmvz+uZ6FKUNtOkmLSSrm4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7a61eb38-a761-472b-9635-d995f3c47355","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\llamaindex apps\\rag-new-demo-local\\data\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf","file_name":"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf"},"hash":"f+/8mrYKeVRh1sJ/5ovEpkzIep9vVlrkUceVZQhXPVI="}},"hash":"nL4ZDaXsI/dZ0vAeQp9rWL/sfi4BV576SNYSs3Fn3/8=","text":"4.4 Fermentation\r\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\r\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\r\n•Discuss the fundamental difference between anaerobic cellular respiration and fermentation\r\n•Describe the type of fermentation that readily occurs in animal cells and the conditions that initiate that\r\nfermentation\r\nIn aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is an oxygen molecule, O2. If aerobic respiration occurs, then ATP\r\nwill be produced using the energy of the high-energy electrons carried by NADH or FADH2to the electron transport\r\nchain. If aerobic respiration does not occur, NADH must be reoxidized to NAD+for reuse as an electron carrier for\r\nglycolysis to continue. How is this done? In some living systems the electron transport chain (ETC) use an organic\r\nmolecule as the final electron acceptor. Processes that use an organic molecule to regenerate NAD+from NADH are\r\ncollectively referred to asfermentation. In contrast, in some living systems, the electron transport chain (ETC) uses\r\nan inorganic molecule (other than oxygen) as a final electron acceptor to regenerate NAD+which is called anaerobic\r\n(do not require oxygen) to achieve NAD+regeneration.

This occurs routinely in mammalian red blood cells and in skeletal muscle that has insufficient oxygen supply\r\nto allow aerobic respiration to continue (that is, in muscles used to the point of fatigue). In muscles, lactic acid\r\nproduced by fermentation must be removed by the blood circulation and brought to the liver for further metabolism. The chemical reaction of lactic acid fermentation is the following:\r\nThe enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction can proceed in either direction, but\r\nthe left-to-right reaction is inhibited by acidic conditions.
