As such, this course\\r\\nrepresents an important opportunity for students to\\r\\ndevelop the necessary knowledge, tools, and skills to\\r\\nmake informed decisions as they continue with their\\r\\nlives. Rather than being mired down with facts and\\r\\nvocabulary, the typical non-science major student\\r\\nneeds information presented in a way that is easy to\\r\\nread and understand. Even more importantly, the\\r\\ncontent should be meaningful. Students do much\\r\\nbetter when they understand why biology is relevant to\\r\\ntheir everyday lives. For these reasons,Concepts of\\r\\nBiologyis grounded on an evolutionary basis and\\r\\nincludes exciting features that highlight careers in the\\r\\nbiological sciences and everyday applications of the\\r\\nconcepts at hand. We also strive to show the\\r\\ninterconnectedness of topics within this extremely\\r\\nbroad discipline. In order to meet the needs of today’s\\r\\ninstructors and students, we maintain the overall\\r\\norganization and coverage found in most syllabi for this\\r\\ncourse. A strength ofConcepts of Biologyis that\\r\\ninstructors can customize the book, adapting it to the\\r\\napproach that works best in their classroom. Concepts\\r\\nof Biology also includes an innovative art program that\\r\\nincorporates critical thinking and clicker questions to\\r\\nhelp students understand—and apply—key concepts.\\r\\nPreface               1\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"OwjuYze+EwSLAhM280JBv2d5JhILbx3MCg130hq/n7k=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"OwjuYze+EwSLAhM280JBv2d5JhILbx3MCg130hq/n7k=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"vQSb95222YMa8efvXLDaLMHVRcfEDqPhaLUrTl9YY5A=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nCoverage and Scope\\r\\nOurConcepts of Biologytextbook adheres to the scope\\r\\nand sequence of most one-semester non-majors\\r\\ncourses nationwide. We also strive to make biology, as\\r\\na discipline, interesting and accessible to students. In\\r\\naddition to a comprehensive coverage of core concepts\\r\\nand foundational research, we have incorporated\\r\\nfeatures that draw learners into the discipline in\\r\\nmeaningful ways. Our scope of content was developed\\r\\nafter surveying over a hundred biology professors and\\r\\nlistening to their coverage needs. We provide a\\r\\nthorough treatment of biology’s fundamental concepts\\r\\nwith a scope that is manageable for instructors and\\r\\nstudents alike.\\r\\n•  Unit 1:The Cellular Foundation of Life. Our\\r\\nopening unit introduces students to the sciences,\\r\\nincluding the process of science and the\\r\\nunderlying concepts from the physical sciences\\r\\nthat provide a framework within which learners\\r\\ncomprehend biological processes. Additionally,\\r\\nstudents will gain solid understanding of the\\r\\nstructures, functions, and processes of the most\\r\\nbasic unit of life: the cell.\\r\\n•  Unit 2:Cell Division and Genetics. Our genetics\\r\\nunit takes learners from the foundations of cellular\\r\\nreproduction to the experiments that revealed the\\r\\nbasis of genetics and laws of inheritance.\\r\\n•  Unit 3:Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.\\r\\nStudents will learn the intricacies of DNA, protein\\r\\nsynthesis, and gene regulation and current\\r\\napplications of biotechnology and genomics.\\r\\n•  Unit 4:Evolution and the Diversity of Life. The\\r\\ncore concepts of evolution are discussed in this\\r\\nunit with examples illustrating evolutionary\\r\\nprocesses. Additionally, the evolutionary basis of\\r\\nbiology reappears throughout the textbook in\\r\\ngeneral discussion and is reinforced through\\r\\nspecial call-out features highlighting specific\\r\\nevolution-based topics. The diversity of life is\\r\\nexplored with detailed study of various organisms\\r\\nand discussion of emerging phylogenetic\\r\\nrelationships between and among bacteria, protist\\r\\nkingdoms, fungi, plants, and animals.\\r\\n•  Unit 5:Animal Structure and Function. An\\r\\nintroduction to the form and function of the animal\\r\\nbody is followed by chapters on the immune\\r\\nsystem and animal development. This unit touches\\r\\non the biology of all organisms while maintaining\\r\\nan engaging focus on human anatomy and\\r\\nphysiology that helps students connect to the\\r\\ntopics.\\r\\n•  Unit 6:Ecology. Ecological concepts are broadly\\r\\ncovered in this unit, with features highlighting\\r\\nlocalized, real-world issues of conservation and\\r\\nbiodiversity.\\r\\nPedagogical Foundation and Features\\r\\nBecause of the impact science has on students and\\r\\nsociety, an important goal of science education is to\\r\\nachieve a scientifically literate population that\\r\\nconsistently makes informed decisions. Scientific\\r\\nliteracy transcends a basic understanding of scientific\\r\\nprinciples and processes to include the ability to make\\r\\nsense of the myriad instances where people encounter\\r\\nscience in day-to-day life. Thus, a scientifically literate\\r\\nperson is one who uses science content knowledge to\\r\\nmake informed decisions, either personally or socially,\\r\\nabout topics or issues that have a connection with\\r\\nscience. Concepts of Biology is grounded on a solid\\r\\nscientific base and designed to promote scientific\\r\\nliteracy. Throughout the text, you will find features that\\r\\nengage the students in scientific inquiry by taking\\r\\nselected topics a step further.\\r\\n•Evolution Connectionfeatures uphold the\\r\\nimportance of evolution to all biological study\\r\\nthrough discussions like “Global Decline of Coral\\r\\nReefs” and “The Red Queen Hypothesis.”\\r\\n•Career Connectionfeatures present information\\r\\non a variety of careers in the biological sciences,\\r\\nintroducing students to the educational\\r\\nrequirements and day-to-day work life of a variety\\r\\nof professions, such as forensic scientists,\\r\\nregistered dietitians, and biogeographers.\\r\\n•Everyday Connectionfeatures tie biological\\r\\nconcepts to emerging issues and discuss science\\r\\nin terms of everyday life. Topics include “Invasive\\r\\nSpecies” and “Photosynthesis at the Grocery\\r\\nStore.”\\r\\nAnswers to Questions in the Book\\r\\nAnswers to Visual Connection Questions, Review\\r\\nQuestions, and Critical Thinking Questions are provided\\r\\nin the Instructor Answer Guide via the Instructor\\r\\nResources page. Select answers to these questions are\\r\\nprovided for students via the Student Resources page.\\r\\nArt and Animations that Engage\\r\\nOur art program takes a straightforward approach\\r\\ndesigned to help students learn the concepts of biology\\r\\nthrough simple, effective illustrations, photos, and\\r\\nmicrographs. Concepts of Biology also incorporates\\r\\nlinks to relevant animations and interactive exercises\\r\\nthat help bring biology to life for students.\\r\\n•Visual Connectionfeatures call out core figures in\\r\\neach chapter for student attention.

How do those various living things function? When faced\\r\\nwith the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that\\r\\nwe can better understand them? And, finally—what biologists ultimately seek to understand—how\\r\\ndid this diversity arise and how is it continuing? As new organisms are discovered every day,\\r\\nbiologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.\\r\\nProperties of Life\\r\\nAll groups of living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or\\r\\nresponse to stimuli, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation/homeostasis,\\r\\nenergy processing, and evolution. When viewed together, these eight characteristics serve to\\r\\ndefine life.\\r\\nOrder\\r\\nOrganisms are highly organized structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple,\\r\\nsingle-celled organisms are remarkably complex. Inside each cell, atoms make up molecules.\\r\\nThese in turn make up cell components or organelles. Multicellular organisms, which may consist\\r\\nof millions of individual cells, have an advantage over single-celled organisms in that their cells\\r\\ncan be specialized to perform specific functions, and even sacrificed in certain situations for the\\r\\ngood of the organism as a whole. How these specialized cells come together to form organs such\\r\\nas the heart, lung, or skin in organisms like the toad shown inFigure 1.2will be discussed later.\\r\\nFIGURE 1.2A toad represents a highly organized structure consisting of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.(credit: \\\"Ivengo(RUS)\\\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\r\\nSensitivity or Response to Stimuli\\r\\nOrganisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light or\\r\\nrespond to touch (Figure 1.3). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a\\r\\nprocess called chemotaxis) or light (phototaxis). Movement toward a stimulus is considered a\\r\\npositive response, while movement away from a stimulus is considered a negative response.\\r\\n6               1 • Introduction to Biology\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"hxfQrBsLZ/iIWFRg1MGTsddm+ATtGgsqpG0AgB9Yg3Q=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"hxfQrBsLZ/iIWFRg1MGTsddm+ATtGgsqpG0AgB9Yg3Q=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"MDEoRzgWwE6YIPvte6X7Z3hSUjzswLvcCWD0x/rUcFI=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 1.3The leaves of this sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched.

Many multicellular organisms (those made up of more\\r\\nthan one cell) produce specialized reproductive cells that will form new individuals. When reproduction occurs, DNA\\r\\ncontaining genes is passed along to an organism’s offspring. These genes are the reason that the offspring will\\r\\nbelong to the same species and will have characteristics similar to the parent, such as fur color and blood type.\\r\\nAdaptation\\r\\nAll living organisms exhibit a “fit” to their environment. Biologists refer to this fit as adaptation and it is a\\r\\nconsequence of evolution by natural selection, which operates in every lineage of reproducing organisms. Examples\\r\\nof adaptations are diverse and unique, from heat-resistant Archaea that live in boiling hot springs to the tongue\\r\\nlength of a nectar-feeding moth that matches the size of the flower from which it feeds.

The source of\\r\\nthis diversity isevolution, the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species.\\r\\nEvolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems.\\r\\nIn the 18th century, a scientist named Carl Linnaeus first proposed organizing the known species of organisms into a\\r\\nhierarchical taxonomy. In this system, species that are most similar to each other are put together within a grouping\\r\\nknown as a genus. Furthermore, similar genera (the plural of genus) are put together within a family. This grouping\\r\\ncontinues until all organisms are collected together into groups at the highest level. The current taxonomic system\\r\\nnow has eight levels in its hierarchy, from lowest to highest, they are: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum,\\r\\nkingdom, domain. Thus species are grouped within genera, genera are grouped within families, families are grouped\\r\\nwithin orders, and so on (Figure 1.9).\\r\\nFIGURE 1.9This diagram shows the levels of taxonomic hierarchy for a dog, from the broadest category—domain—to the mostspecific—species.\\r\\nThe highest level, domain, is a relatively new addition to the system since the 1970s. Scientists now recognize three\\r\\ndomains of life, the Eukarya, the Archaea, and the Bacteria. The domain Eukarya contains organisms that have cells\\r\\nwith nuclei. It includes the kingdoms of fungi, plants, animals, and several kingdoms of protists. The Archaea, are\\r\\nsingle-celled organisms without nuclei and include many extremophiles that live in harsh environments like hot\\r\\nsprings. The Bacteria are another quite different group of single-celled organisms without nuclei (Figure 1.10). Both\\r\\nthe Archaea and the Bacteria are prokaryotes, an informal name for cells without nuclei. The recognition in the\\r\\n1970s that certain “bacteria,” now known as the Archaea, were as different genetically and biochemically from\\r\\nother bacterial cells as they were from eukaryotes, motivated the recommendation to divide life into three domains.\\r\\nThis dramatic change in our knowledge of the tree of life demonstrates that classifications are not permanent and\\r\\nwill change when new information becomes available.\\r\\n12               1 • Introduction to Biology\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"DSM8UvFjheR7y0AHZ6Q8tO8P0X1x59zJZ9LoflHP6rg=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"DSM8UvFjheR7y0AHZ6Q8tO8P0X1x59zJZ9LoflHP6rg=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"5RzA1Cn6CQa9iKACCqX78CcPKDrQuJBVl5Pb3kPC7qQ=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nIn addition to the hierarchical taxonomic system, Linnaeus was the first to name organisms using two unique names,\\r\\nnow called the binomial naming system.

Binomial names consist of the genus\\r\\nname (which is capitalized) and the species name (all lower-case). Both names are set in italics when they are\\r\\nprinted. Every species is given a unique binomial which is recognized the world over, so that a scientist in any\\r\\nlocation can know which organism is being referred to.

A\\r\\nphylogenetic treeis a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on\\r\\nsimilarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both. A phylogenetic tree is composed of branch points, or\\r\\nnodes, and branches. The internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when, based on scientific\\r\\nevidence, an ancestor is thought to have diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch can be\\r\\nconsidered as estimates of relative time.\\r\\nIn the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. The\\r\\npioneering work of American microbiologist Carl Woese in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth\\r\\nhas evolved along three lineages, now called domains—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Woese proposed the\\r\\ndomain as a new taxonomic level and Archaea as a new domain, to reflect the new phylogenetic tree (Figure 1.11).\\r\\nMany organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. To\\r\\nconstruct his tree, Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape). Various\\r\\ngenes were used in phylogenetic studies. Woese’s tree was constructed from comparative sequencing of the genes\\r\\nthat are universally distributed, found in some slightly altered form in every organism, conserved (meaning that\\r\\nthese genes have remained only slightly changed throughout evolution), and of an appropriate length.\\r\\n1.1 • Themes and Concepts of Biology               13\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"DQ0icgmjtiz7UZEwwwx9IMHHP+6Hm0vmwoeVcy8ltPY=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"DQ0icgmjtiz7UZEwwwx9IMHHP+6Hm0vmwoeVcy8ltPY=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"hX46PYAu5Bjro5gyfDAZb/l3qufgB9O8PcO6lMTcRpQ=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 1.11This phylogenetic tree was constructed by microbiologist Carl Woese using genetic relationships.

Interest in forensic science has increased in the last\\r\\nfew years, possibly because of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. Also, the\\r\\ndevelopment of molecular techniques and the establishment of DNA databases have updated the types of work that\\r\\nforensic scientists can do. Their job activities are primarily related to crimes against people such as murder, rape,\\r\\nand assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood, and other body fluids and also processing\\r\\nDNA (Figure 1.13) found in many different environments and materials. Forensic scientists also analyze other\\r\\nbiological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect parts or pollen grains. Students who want to pursue careers\\r\\nin forensic science will most likely be required to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math\\r\\ncourses.\\r\\nFIGURE 1.13This forensic scientist works in a DNA extraction room at the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory.

They\\r\\nalso must ensure that their research and communications are free of bias and that they properly balance financial,\\r\\nlegal, safety, replicability, and other considerations. Bioethics is an important and continually evolving field, in which\\r\\nresearchers collaborate with other thinkers and organizations. They work to define guidelines for current practice,\\r\\nand also continually consider new developments and emerging technologies in order to form answers for the years\\r\\nand decades to come.\\r\\nUnfortunately, the emergence of bioethics as a field came after a number of clearly unethical practices, where\\r\\nbiologists did not treat research subjects with dignity and in some cases did them harm. In the 1932 Tuskegee\\r\\nsyphilis study, 399 African American men were diagnosed with syphilis but were never informed that they had the\\r\\ndisease, leaving them to live with and pass on the illness to others. Doctors even withheld proven medications\\r\\nbecause the goal of the study was to understand the impact of untreated syphilis on Black men.\\r\\nWhile the decisions made in the Tuskegee study are unjustifiable, some decisions are genuinely difficult to make.\\r\\nFor example, bioethicists may examine the implications of gene editing technologies, including the ability to create\\r\\norganisms that may displace others in the environment, as well as the ability to “design” human beings. In that\\r\\neffort, ethicists will likely seek to balance the positive outcomes -- such as improved therapies or prevention of\\r\\ncertain illnesses -- with negative outcomes.\\r\\nBioethics are not simple, and often leave scientists balancing benefits with harm. In this text and course, you will\\r\\ndiscuss medical discoveries that, at their core, have what many consider an ethical lapse. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks,\\r\\na 30-year-old African American woman, was diagnosed with cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Unique\\r\\ncharacteristics of her illnesses gave her cells the ability to divide continuously, essentially making them “immortal.”\\r\\nWithout her knowledge or permission, researchers took samples of her cells and with them created the immortal\\r\\nHeLa cell line. These cells have contributed to major medical discoveries, including the polio vaccine and work\\r\\nrelated to cancer, AIDS, cell aging, and even very recently in COVID-19 research. For the most part, Lacks has not\\r\\nbeen credited for her role in those discoveries, and her family has not benefited from the billions of dollars in\\r\\npharmaceutical profits obtained partly through the use of her cells.\\r\\nToday, harvesting tissue or organs from a dying patient without consent is not only considered unethical but also\\r\\nillegal, regardless of whether such an act could save other patients’ lives. Part of the role of ethics in scientific\\r\\nresearch is to examine similar issues before, during, and after research or practice takes place, as well as to adhere\\r\\nto established professional principles and consider the dignity and safety of all organisms involved or affected by the\\r\\nwork.\\r\\n1.2 The Process of Science\\r\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\r\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\r\\n•Identify the shared characteristics of the natural sciences\\r\\n•Understand the process of scientific inquiry\\r\\n•Compare inductive reasoning with deductive reasoning\\r\\n•Describe the goals of basic science and applied science\\r\\n16               1 • Introduction to Biology\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"904xQbBcp/2wN9Ram83Ru2P+sTmG9ZR3hxcyCA8S/yU=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"904xQbBcp/2wN9Ram83Ru2P+sTmG9ZR3hxcyCA8S/yU=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"gfyUZuAeagrSqLnpTfZt6W7xQ4BYxn4C5B0I6zNSGwk=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 1.14Formerly called blue-green algae, the (a) cyanobacteria seen through a light microscope are some of Earth’s oldest life forms.These (b) stromatolites along the shores of Lake Thetis in Western Australia are ancient structures formed by the layering of cyanobacteria\\r\\nin shallow waters.

There are however, areas of knowledge and human\\r\\nexperience that the methods of science cannot be applied to. These include such things as answering purely moral\\r\\nquestions, aesthetic questions, or what can be generally categorized as spiritual questions. Science cannot\\r\\ninvestigate these areas because they are outside the realm of material phenomena, the phenomena of matter and\\r\\nenergy, and cannot be observed and measured.\\r\\nThescientific methodis a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation.\\r\\nThe steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this\\r\\nmethod is the testing of hypotheses. Ahypothesisis a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested.\\r\\nHypotheses, or tentative explanations, are generally produced within the context of ascientific theory. A generally\\r\\naccepted scientific theory is thoroughly tested and confirmed explanation for a set of observations or phenomena.\\r\\nScientific theory is the foundation of scientific knowledge. In addition, in many scientific disciplines (less so in\\r\\nbiology) there arescientific laws, often expressed in mathematical formulas, which describe how elements of\\r\\nnature will behave under certain specific conditions. There is not an evolution of hypotheses through theories to\\r\\nlaws as if they represented some increase in certainty about the world. Hypotheses are the day-to-day material that\\r\\nscientists work with and they are developed within the context of theories. Laws are concise descriptions of parts of\\r\\nthe world that are amenable to formulaic or mathematical description.\\r\\nNatural Sciences\\r\\nWhat would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons? Exhibits about\\r\\nhow the brain functions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Or maybe all of the above? Science includes such\\r\\ndiverse fields as astronomy, biology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (Figure\\r\\n1.16). However, those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are\\r\\nconsiderednatural sciences. Thus, a museum of natural sciences might contain any of the items listed above.\\r\\nFIGURE 1.16Some fields of science include astronomy, biology, computer science, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics.(credit: \\\"Image Editor\\\"/Flickr)\\r\\nThere is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences include.

A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and\\r\\nrecords them. These data can be qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (consisting of numbers), and the raw data\\r\\ncan be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many observations, the scientist can infer\\r\\nconclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from\\r\\ncareful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain studies often work this way. Many brains are\\r\\nobserved while people are doing a task. The part of the brain that lights up, indicating activity, is then demonstrated\\r\\nto be the part controlling the response to that task.\\r\\nDeductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reasoning, the\\r\\npattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning.Deductive reasoningis a\\r\\nform of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to predict specific results. From those general principles,\\r\\na scientist can deduce and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid.\\r\\nFor example, a prediction would be that if the climate is becoming warmer in a region, the distribution of plants and\\r\\nanimals should change. Comparisons have been made between distributions in the past and the present, and the\\r\\nmany changes that have been found are consistent with a warming climate. Finding the change in distribution is\\r\\nevidence that the climate change conclusion is a valid one.\\r\\nBoth types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and\\r\\nhypothesis-based science.Descriptive(or discovery)scienceaims to observe, explore, and discover, while\\r\\nhypothesis-based sciencebegins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be\\r\\ntested. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, because most scientific endeavors\\r\\ncombine both approaches. Observations lead to questions, questions lead to forming a hypothesis as a possible\\r\\nanswer to those questions, and then the hypothesis is tested. Thus, descriptive science and hypothesis-based\\r\\nscience are in continuous dialogue.\\r\\nHypothesis Testing\\r\\nBiologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses. This approach\\r\\nis common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was\\r\\nused even in ancient times, but it was first documented by England’s Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) (Figure 1.17),\\r\\nwho set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry. The scientific method is not exclusively used by biologists but\\r\\ncan be applied to almost anything as a logical problem-solving method.\\r\\nFIGURE 1.17Sir Francis Bacon is credited with being the first to document the scientific method.\\r\\n1.2 • The Process of Science               19\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"tua1CY3e0pO3QfizDE7/FudMHYxbqfKpWCSIDFijtzc=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"tua1CY3e0pO3QfizDE7/FudMHYxbqfKpWCSIDFijtzc=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"vXXoGVAxS6yIpnHTeQFsKcmfuJLiAIkA7cpN6pu6fkw=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nThe scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to be solved) that leads to a question.\\r\\nLet’s think about a simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the\\r\\nproblem. One Monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That\\r\\nis an observation that also describes a problem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: “Why\\r\\nis the classroom so warm?”\\r\\nRecall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested. To solve a problem, several hypotheses may\\r\\nbe proposed. For example, one hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because no one turned on the air\\r\\nconditioning.” But there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be\\r\\nproposed. A second hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air\\r\\nconditioning doesn’t work.”\\r\\nOnce a hypothesis has been selected, a prediction may be made. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it\\r\\ntypically has the format “If . . . then . . . .” For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, “Ifthe\\r\\nstudent turns on the air conditioning,thenthe classroom will no longer be too warm.”\\r\\nA hypothesis must be testable to ensure that it is valid. For example, a hypothesis that depends on what a bear\\r\\nthinks is not testable, because it can never be known what a bear thinks. It should also befalsifiable, meaning that\\r\\nit can be disproven by experimental results. An example of an unfalsifiable hypothesis is “Botticelli’sBirth of Venus\\r\\nis beautiful.” There is no experiment that might show this statement to be false. To test a hypothesis, a researcher\\r\\nwill conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. This is important. A\\r\\nhypothesis can be disproven, or eliminated, but it can never be proven. Science does not deal in proofs like\\r\\nmathematics. If an experiment fails to disprove a hypothesis, then we find support for that explanation, but this is\\r\\nnot to say that down the road a better explanation will not be found, or a more carefully designed experiment will be\\r\\nfound to falsify the hypothesis.\\r\\nEach experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls. Avariableis any part of the experiment\\r\\nthat can vary or change during the experiment. Acontrolis a part of the experiment that does not change. Look for\\r\\nthe variables and controls in the example that follows. As a simple example, an experiment might be conducted to\\r\\ntest the hypothesis that phosphate limits the growth of algae in freshwater ponds. A series of artificial ponds are\\r\\nfilled with water and half of them are treated by adding phosphate each week, while the other half are treated by\\r\\nadding a salt that is known not to be used by algae. The variable here is the phosphate (or lack of phosphate), the\\r\\nexperimental or treatment cases are the ponds with added phosphate and the control ponds are those with\\r\\nsomething inert added, such as the salt. Just adding something is also a control against the possibility that adding\\r\\nextra matter to the pond has an effect. If the treated ponds show lesser growth of algae, then we have found\\r\\nsupport for our hypothesis. If they do not, then we reject our hypothesis. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis\\r\\ndoes not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates one hypothesis that\\r\\nis not valid (Figure 1.18). Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data\\r\\nare rejected.\\r\\nIn recent years a new approach of testing hypotheses has developed as a result of an exponential growth of data\\r\\ndeposited in various databases. Using computer algorithms and statistical analyses of data in databases, a new field\\r\\nof so-called \\\"data research\\\" (also referred to as \\\"in silico\\\" research) provides new methods of data analyses and\\r\\ntheir interpretation. This will increase the demand for specialists in both biology and computer science, a promising\\r\\ncareer opportunity.\\r\\n20               1 • Introduction to Biology\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"j7cUc59HcEdwcj1mv5+xYl31PmUQtRQ4t+PBTtqpc9w=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"j7cUc59HcEdwcj1mv5+xYl31PmUQtRQ4t+PBTtqpc9w=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"4mBjD+YKc4qaAfYinmISMJE1qpWUgaEkzJi72DmllcE=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nVISUAL CONNECTION\\r\\nFIGURE 1.18The scientific method is a series of defined steps that include experiments and careful observation.

This question focuses on the differences\\r\\nbetween two types of science: basic science and applied science.\\r\\nBasic scienceor “pure” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that\\r\\nknowledge. It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The\\r\\nimmediate goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledge’s sake, though this does not mean that in the end it\\r\\nmay not result in an application.\\r\\nIn contrast,applied scienceor “technology,” aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible,\\r\\nfor example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural\\r\\ndisaster. In applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.\\r\\nSome individuals may perceive applied science as “useful” and basic science as “useless.” A question these people\\r\\nmight pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, “What for?” A careful look at the history of\\r\\nscience, however, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. Many\\r\\nscientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before an application is developed; therefore,\\r\\napplied science relies on the results generated through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move\\r\\non from basic science and instead to find solutions to actual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that\\r\\nthere are problems that demand immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of\\r\\nthe knowledge generated through basic science.\\r\\nOne example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the\\r\\ndiscovery of DNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication.\\r\\nStrands of DNA, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life.\\r\\nDuring DNA replication, new copies of DNA are made, shortly before a cell divides to form new cells. Understanding\\r\\nthe mechanisms of DNA replication enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to\\r\\nidentify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine paternity. Without basic\\r\\nscience, it is unlikely that applied science could exist.\\r\\nAnother example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project, a study in which\\r\\neach human chromosome was analyzed and mapped to determine the precise sequence of DNA subunits and the\\r\\nexact location of each gene. (The gene is the basic unit of heredity represented by a specific DNA segment that\\r\\ncodes for a functional molecule.) Other organisms have also been studied as part of this project to gain a better\\r\\nunderstanding of human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (Figure 1.19) relied on basic research carried\\r\\nout with non-human organisms and, later, with the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using\\r\\nthe data for applied research seeking cures for genetically related diseases.\\r\\nFIGURE 1.19The Human Genome Project was a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several different fields ofscience.

Communication and collaboration within and between sub\\r\\ndisciplines of science are key to the advancement of knowledge in science. For this reason, an important aspect of a\\r\\nscientist’s work is disseminating results and communicating with peers. Scientists can share results by presenting\\r\\nthem at a scientific meeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the limited few who are present.\\r\\nInstead, most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed articles that are published in scientific journals.\\r\\nPeer-reviewed articlesare scientific papers that are reviewed, usually anonymously by a scientist’s colleagues, or\\r\\npeers. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who judge whether or not\\r\\nthe scientist’s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research\\r\\ndescribed in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which\\r\\nare requests for research funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their work so other scientists\\r\\ncan reproduce their experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings.\\r\\nThere are many journals and the popular press that do not use a peer-review system. A large number of online\\r\\nopen-access journals, journals with articles available without cost, are now available many of which use rigorous\\r\\npeer-review systems, but some of which do not. Results of any studies published in these forums without peer\\r\\nreview are not reliable and should not form the basis for other scientific work.

All\\r\\nmatter is composed ofelements, substances that cannot be broken down or transformed\\r\\nchemically into other substances. Each element is made of atoms, each with a constant number of\\r\\nprotons and unique properties. A total of 118 elements have been defined; however, only 92 occur\\r\\nnaturally, and fewer than 30 are found in living cells. The remaining 26 elements are unstable and,\\r\\ntherefore, do not exist for very long or are theoretical and have yet to be detected.\\r\\nEach element is designated by its chemical symbol (such as H, N, O, C, and Na), and possesses\\r\\nunique properties. These unique properties allow elements to combine and to bond with each\\r\\nother in specific ways.\\r\\nAtoms\\r\\nAn atom is the smallest component of an element that retains all of the chemical properties of\\r\\nthat element. For example, one hydrogen atom has all of the properties of the element hydrogen,\\r\\nsuch as it exists as a gas at room temperature, and it bonds with oxygen to create a water\\r\\nmolecule. Hydrogen atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the\\r\\nproperties of hydrogen. If a hydrogen atom were broken down into subatomic particles, it would\\r\\nno longer have the properties of hydrogen.\\r\\nAt the most basic level, all organisms are made of a combination of elements. They contain atoms\\r\\nthat combine together to form molecules. In multicellular organisms, such as animals, molecules\\r\\ncan interact to form cells that combine to form tissues, which make up organs. These\\r\\ncombinations continue until entire multicellular organisms are formed.\\r\\nAll atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons (Figure 2.2). The most common isotope of\\r\\nhydrogen (H) is the only exception and is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons. A\\r\\nprotonis a positively charged particle that resides in thenucleus(the core of the atom) of an atom\\r\\nand has a mass of 1 and a charge of +1. Anelectronis a negatively charged particle that travels in\\r\\nthe space around the nucleus. In other words, it resides outside of the nucleus. It has a negligible\\r\\nmass and has a charge of –1.\\r\\nFIGURE 2.2Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus, and electrons surrounding thenucleus.\\r\\nNeutrons, like protons, reside in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of 1 and no charge.\\r\\nThe positive (protons) and negative (electrons) charges balance each other in a neutral atom,\\r\\nwhich has a net zero charge.\\r\\n28               2 • Chemistry of Life\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"zILgllDBxP8thio3DKhRdhTbuU4Su7zi3EmLuxgjKRw=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"zILgllDBxP8thio3DKhRdhTbuU4Su7zi3EmLuxgjKRw=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"4Gfo8g5qvze+AMUexEMoU5bMBV9B6C444jMCCepwVuI=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nBecause protons and neutrons each have a mass of 1, the mass of an atom is equal to the number of protons and\\r\\nneutrons of that atom. The number of electrons does not factor into the overall mass, because their mass is so\\r\\nsmall.\\r\\nAs stated earlier, each element has its own unique properties. Each contains a different number of protons and\\r\\nneutrons, giving it its own atomic number and mass number. Theatomic numberof an element is equal to the\\r\\nnumber of protons that element contains. Themass number, or atomic mass, is the number of protons plus the\\r\\nnumber of neutrons of that element. Therefore, it is possible to determine the number of neutrons by subtracting\\r\\nthe atomic number from the mass number.\\r\\nThese numbers provide information about the elements and how they will react when combined. Different elements\\r\\nhave different melting and boiling points, and are in different states (liquid, solid, or gas) at room temperature. They\\r\\nalso combine in different ways. Some form specific types of bonds, whereas others do not. How they combine is\\r\\nbased on the number of electrons present. Because of these characteristics, the elements are arranged into the\\r\\nperiodic table of elements, a chart of the elements that includes the atomic number and relative atomic mass of\\r\\neach element. The periodic table also provides key information about the properties of elements (Figure 2.2)—often\\r\\nindicated by color-coding. The arrangement of the table also shows how the electrons in each element are\\r\\norganized and provides important details about how atoms will react with each other to form molecules.\\r\\nIsotopesare different forms of the same element that have the same number of protons, but a different number of\\r\\nneutrons. Some elements, such as carbon, potassium, and uranium, have naturally occurring isotopes. Carbon-12,\\r\\nthe most common isotope of carbon, contains six protons and six neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 12\\r\\n(six protons and six neutrons) and an atomic number of 6 (which makes it carbon). Carbon-14 contains six protons\\r\\nand eight neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 14 (six protons and eight neutrons) and an atomic number of\\r\\n6, meaning it is still the element carbon. These two alternate forms of carbon are isotopes. Some isotopes are\\r\\nunstable and will lose protons, other subatomic particles, or energy to form more stable elements.

This is a\\r\\ncontinuous process, so more14C is always being created. As a living organism develops, the relative level of14C in\\r\\nits body is equal to the concentration of14C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting14C,\\r\\nso the ratio will decline.14C decays to14N by a process called beta decay; it gives off energy in this slow process.\\r\\nAfter approximately 5,730 years, only one-half of the starting concentration of14C will have been converted to14N.\\r\\nThe time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay to its more stable form is called its half-\\r\\nlife. Because the half-life of14C is long, it is used to age formerly living objects, such as fossils. Using the ratio of the\\r\\n14C concentration found in an object to the amount of14C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope\\r\\nthat has not yet decayed can be determined. Based on this amount, the age of the fossil can be calculated to about\\r\\n50,000 years (Figure 2.4). Isotopes with longer half-lives, such as potassium-40, are used to calculate the ages of\\r\\nolder fossils. Through the use of carbon dating, scientists can reconstruct the ecology and biogeography of\\r\\norganisms living within the past 50,000 years.\\r\\n30               2 • Chemistry of Life\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"SXRuHPGJUdFrnNjg5l+NTl3L3fpR9ZD9RhwnK61Kkog=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"SXRuHPGJUdFrnNjg5l+NTl3L3fpR9ZD9RhwnK61Kkog=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"D5iz5vcCxUVBO4q1B3R7hf5XTI8HfCuVKRzFlVKmLQI=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 2.4The age of remains that contain carbon and are less than about 50,000 years old, such as this pygmy mammoth, can bedetermined using carbon dating.

Electrons exist at energy levels that\\r\\nform shells around the nucleus. The closest shell can hold up to two electrons. The closest shell to the nucleus is\\r\\nalways filled first, before any other shell can be filled. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot\\r\\noccupied within the lowest shell. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the lowest shell with its\\r\\ntwo electrons. If you look at the periodic table, you will see that hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in\\r\\nthe first row. This is because they only have electrons in their first shell. Hydrogen and helium are the only two\\r\\nelements that have the lowest shell and no other shells.\\r\\nThe second and third energy levels can hold up to eight electrons. The eight electrons are arranged in four pairs and\\r\\none position in each pair is filled with an electron before any pairs are completed.\\r\\nLooking at the periodic table again (Figure 2.3), you will notice that there are seven rows. These rows correspond to\\r\\nthe number of shells that the elements within that row have. The elements within a particular row have increasing\\r\\nnumbers of electrons as the columns proceed from left to right. Although each element has the same number of\\r\\nshells, not all of the shells are completely filled with electrons. If you look at the second row of the periodic table,\\r\\nyou will find lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and neon (Ne).\\r\\nThese all have electrons that occupy only the first and second shells. Lithium has only one electron in its outermost\\r\\nshell, beryllium has two electrons, boron has three, and so on, until the entire shell is filled with eight electrons, as is\\r\\nthe case with neon.\\r\\nNot all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells, but an atom is at its most stable when all of the\\r\\nelectron positions in the outermost shell are filled. Because of these vacancies in the outermost shells, we see the\\r\\nformation ofchemical bonds, or interactions between two or more of the same or different elements that result in\\r\\nthe formation of molecules. To achieve greater stability, atoms will tend to completely fill their outer shells and will\\r\\nbond with other elements to accomplish this goal by sharing electrons, accepting electrons from another atom, or\\r\\ndonating electrons to another atom.

An element can\\r\\ndonate, accept, or share electrons with other elements to fill its outer shell and satisfy the octet rule.\\r\\nWhen an atom does not contain equal numbers of protons and electrons, it is called anion. Because the number of\\r\\nelectrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge. Positive ions are formed by losing\\r\\nelectrons and are calledcations. Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are calledanions.\\r\\nFor example, sodium only has one electron in its outermost shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one\\r\\nelectron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11\\r\\nprotons and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now called a sodium ion.\\r\\nThe chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one\\r\\nelectron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons and 18 electrons,\\r\\ngiving it a net negative (–1) charge. It is now called a chloride ion. This movement of electrons from one element to\\r\\nanother is referred to aselectron transfer. AsFigure 2.5illustrates, a sodium atom (Na) only has one electron in its\\r\\noutermost shell, whereas a chlorine atom (Cl) has seven electrons in its outermost shell. A sodium atom will donate\\r\\nits one electron to empty its shell, and a chlorine atom will accept that electron to fill its shell, becoming chloride.\\r\\nBoth ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no\\r\\nlonger equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium) or –1 (chloride) charge.\\r\\nFIGURE 2.5Elements tend to fill their outermost shells with electrons. To do this, they can either donate or accept electrons from otherelements.\\r\\nIonic Bonds\\r\\nThere are four types of bonds or interactions: ionic, covalent, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions. Ionic\\r\\nand covalent bonds are strong interactions that require a larger energy input to break apart. When an element\\r\\ndonates an electron from its outer shell, as in the sodium atom example above, a positive ion is formed. The\\r\\nelement accepting the electron is now negatively charged. Because positive and negative charges attract, these ions\\r\\nstay together and form anionic bond, or a bond between ions. The elements bond together with the electron from\\r\\none element staying predominantly with the other element. When Na+and Cl–ions combine to produce NaCl, an\\r\\nelectron from a sodium atom stays with the other seven from the chlorine atom, and the sodium and chloride ions\\r\\nattract each other in a lattice of ions with a net zero charge.\\r\\nCovalent Bonds\\r\\nAnother type of strong chemical bond between two or more atoms is acovalent bond. These bonds form when an\\r\\nelectron is shared between two elements and are the strongest and most common form of chemical bond in living\\r\\norganisms.

The\\r\\nelectron from the hydrogen atom divides its time between the outer shell of the hydrogen atom and the incomplete\\r\\nouter shell of the oxygen atom. To completely fill the outer shell of an oxygen atom, two electrons from two\\r\\nhydrogen atoms are needed, hence the subscript “2” in H2O. The electrons are shared between the atoms, dividing\\r\\ntheir time between them to “fill” the outer shell of each. This sharing is a lower energy state for all of the atoms\\r\\ninvolved than if they existed without their outer shells filled.\\r\\nThere are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar.Nonpolar covalent bondsform between two atoms of\\r\\nthe same element or between different elements that share the electrons equally. For example, an oxygen atom can\\r\\nbond with another oxygen atom to fill their outer shells. This association is nonpolar because the electrons will be\\r\\nequally distributed between each oxygen atom. Two covalent bonds form between the two oxygen atoms because\\r\\noxygen requires two shared electrons to fill its outermost shell. Nitrogen atoms will form three covalent bonds (also\\r\\ncalled triple covalent) between two atoms of nitrogen because each nitrogen atom needs three electrons to fill its\\r\\noutermost shell. Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is found in the methane (CH4) molecule. The carbon\\r\\natom has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen\\r\\natoms, each atom providing one. These elements all share the electrons equally, creating four nonpolar covalent\\r\\nbonds (Figure 2.6).\\r\\nIn apolar covalent bond, the electrons shared by the atoms spend more time closer to one nucleus than to the\\r\\nother nucleus. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the different nuclei, a slightly positive (δ+)\\r\\nor slightly negative (δ–) charge develops. The covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are\\r\\npolar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus, giving it a small negative\\r\\ncharge, than they spend near the hydrogen nuclei, giving these molecules a small positive charge.\\r\\nFIGURE 2.6The water molecule (left) depicts a polar bond with a slightly positive charge on the hydrogen atoms and a slightly negativecharge on the oxygen. Examples of nonpolar bonds include methane (middle) and oxygen (right).\\r\\nHydrogen Bonds\\r\\nIonic and covalent bonds are strong bonds that require considerable energy to break. However, not all bonds\\r\\nbetween elements are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form. These are attractions that occur\\r\\nbetween positive and negative charges that do not require much energy to break. Two weak bonds that occur\\r\\nfrequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. These bonds give rise to the unique properties of\\r\\nwater and the unique structures of DNA and proteins.\\r\\nWhen polar covalent bonds containing a hydrogen atom form, the hydrogen atom in that bond has a slightly positive\\r\\ncharge. This is because the shared electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the\\r\\nhydrogen nucleus. Because the hydrogen atom is slightly positive (δ+), it will be attracted to neighboring negative\\r\\npartial charges (δ–). When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the δ+ charge of the hydrogen atom of\\r\\none molecule and the δ– charge of the other molecule. This interaction is called ahydrogen bond. This type of bond\\r\\nis common; for example, the liquid nature of water is caused by the hydrogen bonds between water molecules\\r\\n(Figure 2.7).

These tests provide data for disease diagnoses by creating images of your organs\\r\\nor skeletal system.\\r\\nMRI imaging works by subjecting hydrogen nuclei, which are abundant in the water in soft tissues, to fluctuating\\r\\nmagnetic fields, which cause them to emit their own magnetic field.

They\\r\\nproduce films or images of the body that help medical professionals examine and diagnose.

Approximately 60–70\\r\\npercent of your body is made up of water. Without it, life simply would not exist.\\r\\nWater Is Polar\\r\\nThe hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water molecules form polar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend\\r\\nmore time associated with the oxygen atom than they do with hydrogen atoms. There is no overall charge to a water\\r\\nmolecule, but there is a slight positive charge on each hydrogen atom and a slight negative charge on the oxygen\\r\\natom. Because of these charges, the slightly positive hydrogen atoms repel each other and form the unique shape\\r\\nseen inFigure 2.7. Each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the positive and negative\\r\\ncharges in the different parts of the molecule. Water also attracts other polar molecules (such as sugars), forming\\r\\nhydrogen bonds. When a substance readily forms hydrogen bonds with water, it can dissolve in water and is referred\\r\\nto ashydrophilic(“water-loving”). Hydrogen bonds are not readily formed with nonpolar substances like oils and\\r\\nfats (Figure 2.8). These nonpolar compounds arehydrophobic(“water-fearing”) and will not dissolve in water.\\r\\nFIGURE 2.8As this macroscopic image of oil and water show, oil is a nonpolar compound and, hence, will not dissolve in water. Oil andwater do not mix. (credit: Gautam Dogra)\\r\\nWater Stabilizes Temperature\\r\\nThe hydrogen bonds in water allow it to absorb and release heat energy more slowly than many other substances.\\r\\nTemperatureis a measure of the motion (kinetic energy) of molecules. As the motion increases, energy is higher\\r\\nand thus temperature is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature rises. Increased energy\\r\\ndisrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Because these bonds can be created and disrupted rapidly,\\r\\nwater absorbs an increase in energy and temperature changes only minimally. This means that water moderates\\r\\ntemperature changes within organisms and in their environments. As energy input continues, the balance between\\r\\nhydrogen-bond formation and destruction swings toward the destruction side. More bonds are broken than are\\r\\nformed. This process results in the release of individual water molecules at the surface of the liquid (such as a body\\r\\nof water, the leaves of a plant, or the skin of an organism) in a process calledevaporation. Evaporation of sweat,\\r\\nwhich is 90 percent water, allows for cooling of an organism, because breaking hydrogen bonds requires an input of\\r\\nenergy and takes heat away from the body.\\r\\nConversely, as molecular motion decreases and temperatures drop, less energy is present to break the hydrogen\\r\\nbonds between water molecules. These bonds remain intact and begin to form a rigid, lattice-like structure (e.g.,\\r\\nice) (Figure 2.9a). When frozen, ice is less dense than liquid water (the molecules are farther apart). This means that\\r\\nice floats on the surface of a body of water (Figure 2.9b). In lakes, ponds, and oceans, ice will form on the surface of\\r\\nthe water, creating an insulating barrier to protect the animal and plant life beneath from freezing in the water. If this\\r\\ndid not happen, plants and animals living in water would freeze in a block of ice and could not move freely, making\\r\\nlife in cold temperatures difficult or impossible.\\r\\n2.2 • Water               35\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"bZX5aWxQJuRhU56hAg3rqO+t0amQcntEbmb3LzmRN9Q=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"bZX5aWxQJuRhU56hAg3rqO+t0amQcntEbmb3LzmRN9Q=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"FZOtHFZc9mdy+fvJ89X4WTbXWIKmQ23cOhp/IcCgMg8=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 2.9(a) The lattice structure of ice makes it less dense than the freely flowing molecules of liquid water.

There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\\r\\nnucleic acids), and each is an important component of the cell and performs a wide array of functions. Combined,\\r\\nthese molecules make up the majority of a cell’s dry mass. Biological macromolecules are organic, meaning they\\r\\ncontain carbon and are bound to hydrogen, and may contain oxygen, nitrogen, and additional minor elements.\\r\\nCarbon\\r\\nIt is often said that life is “carbon-based.” This means that carbon atoms, bonded to other carbon atoms or other\\r\\nelements, form the fundamental components of many, if not most, of the molecules found uniquely in living things.\\r\\nOther elements play important roles in biological molecules, but carbon certainly qualifies as the “foundation”\\r\\nelement for molecules in living things. It is the bonding properties of carbon atoms that are responsible for its\\r\\nimportant role.\\r\\nCarbon Bonding\\r\\nCarbon contains four electrons in its outer shell. Therefore, it can form four covalent bonds with other atoms or\\r\\nmolecules. The simplest organic carbon molecule is methane (CH4), in which four hydrogen atoms bind to a carbon\\r\\natom (Figure 2.13).\\r\\nFIGURE 2.13Carbon can form four covalent bonds to create an organic molecule. The simplest carbon molecule is methane (CH4),depicted here.\\r\\nHowever, structures that are more complex are made using carbon. Any of the hydrogen atoms can be replaced with\\r\\nanother carbon atom covalently bonded to the first carbon atom. In this way, long and branching chains of carbon\\r\\ncompounds can be made (Figure 2.14a). The carbon atoms may bond with atoms of other elements, such as\\r\\nnitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus (Figure 2.14b). The molecules may also form rings, which themselves can link\\r\\nwith other rings (Figure 2.14c). This diversity of molecular forms accounts for the diversity of functions of the\\r\\nbiological macromolecules and is based to a large degree on the ability of carbon to form multiple bonds with itself\\r\\nand other atoms.\\r\\n2.3 • Biological Molecules               39\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"rVrcz2znYB89xPnPZyWsoWZ9rTnZ0XWPf+Ib1e9O7b8=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"rVrcz2znYB89xPnPZyWsoWZ9rTnZ0XWPf+Ib1e9O7b8=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"V15riPw1IGY0UNaLZee5eUAL4BLnoxJzGequ72sX6nw=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 2.14These examples show three molecules (found in living organisms) that contain carbon atoms bonded in various ways to othercarbon atoms and the atoms of other elements.

Athletes, in contrast, often “carb-load” before important competitions to\\r\\nensure that they have sufficient energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our\\r\\ndiet; grains, fruits, and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide energy to the\\r\\nbody, particularly through glucose, a simple sugar. Carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans,\\r\\nanimals, and plants.\\r\\nCarbohydrates can be represented by the formula (CH2O)n, wherenis the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.\\r\\nIn other words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. Carbohydrates are\\r\\nclassified into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.\\r\\nMonosaccharides(mono- = “one”; sacchar- = “sweet”) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. In\\r\\nmonosaccharides, the number of carbon atoms usually ranges from three to six. Most monosaccharide names end\\r\\nwith the suffix -ose. Depending on the number of carbon atoms in the sugar, they may be known as trioses (three\\r\\ncarbon atoms), pentoses (five carbon atoms), and hexoses (six carbon atoms).\\r\\nMonosaccharides may exist as a linear chain or as ring-shaped molecules; in aqueous solutions, they are usually\\r\\nfound in the ring form.\\r\\nThe chemical formula for glucose is C6H12O6.

For example,\\r\\ndietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to manage blood-sugar levels by eating the correct types and\\r\\namounts of carbohydrates. Dietitians may also work in nursing homes, schools, and private practices.\\r\\nTo become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelor’s degree in dietetics, nutrition, food\\r\\ntechnology, or a related field. In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship program and\\r\\npass a national exam.

In a\\r\\nfat molecule, a fatty acid is attached to each of the three oxygen atoms in the –OH groups of the glycerol molecule\\r\\nwith a covalent bond (Figure 2.18).\\r\\nFIGURE 2.18Lipids include fats, such as triglycerides, which are made up of fatty acids and glycerol, phospholipids, and steroids.\\r\\nDuring this covalent bond formation, three water molecules are released. The three fatty acids in the fat may be\\r\\nsimilar or dissimilar. These fats are also calledtriglyceridesbecause they have three fatty acids.

For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the\\r\\npalm tree. Arachidic acid is derived fromArachis hypogaea, the scientific name for peanuts.\\r\\nFatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between\\r\\nneighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is saturated.Saturated fatty acidsare saturated with\\r\\nhydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized.\\r\\nWhen the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond, the fatty acid is anunsaturated fatty acid.\\r\\nMost unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are calledoils. If there is one double bond in the\\r\\nmolecule, then it is known as a monounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then\\r\\nit is known as a polyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil).\\r\\nSaturated fats tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic acid and\\r\\npalmitic acid contained in meat, and the fat with butyric acid contained in butter, are examples of saturated fats.\\r\\nMammals store fats in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy most of the cell. In plants,\\r\\nfat or oil is stored in seeds and is used as a source of energy during embryonic development.\\r\\nUnsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain unsaturated fatty acids. The double bond causes a\\r\\nbend or a “kink” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature. Olive\\r\\noil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats help to improve blood\\r\\ncholesterol levels, whereas saturated fats might contribute to plaque formation in the arteries, which increases the\\r\\nrisk of a heart attack.\\r\\nIn the food industry, oils are artificially hydrogenated to make them semi-solid, leading to less spoilage and\\r\\nincreased shelf life. Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. During this\\r\\nhydrogenation process, double bonds of thecis-conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted to double\\r\\nbonds in thetrans-conformation. This forms atrans-fatfrom acis-fat. The orientation of the double bonds affects\\r\\nthe chemical properties of the fat (Figure 2.19).\\r\\nFIGURE 2.19During the hydrogenation process, the orientation around the double bonds is changed, making atrans-fat from acis-fat. Thischanges the chemical properties of the molecule.\\r\\nMargarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenatedtrans-fats. Recent\\r\\nstudies have shown that an increase intrans-fats in the human diet may lead to an increase in levels of low-density\\r\\nlipoprotein (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol, which, in turn, may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in\\r\\nheart disease. Many fast food restaurants have recently eliminated the use oftrans-fats, and U.S. food labels are\\r\\nnow required to list theirtrans-fat content.\\r\\nEssential fatty acids are fatty acids that are required but not synthesized by the human body. Consequently, they\\r\\nmust be supplemented through the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids fall into this category and are one of only two known\\r\\nessential fatty acids for humans (the other being omega-6 fatty acids).

Omega-3 fatty acids are important in brain\\r\\nfunction and normal growth and development. They may also prevent heart disease and reduce the risk of cancer.\\r\\nLike carbohydrates, fats have received a lot of bad publicity. It is true that eating an excess of fried foods and other\\r\\n“fatty” foods leads to weight gain. However, fats do have important functions. Fats serve as long-term energy\\r\\nstorage. They also provide insulation for the body. Therefore, “healthy” unsaturated fats in moderate amounts\\r\\nshould be consumed on a regular basis.\\r\\nPhospholipidsare the major constituent of the plasma membrane. Like fats, they are composed of fatty acid chains\\r\\nattached to a glycerol or similar backbone. Instead of three fatty acids attached, however, there are two fatty acids\\r\\nand the third carbon of the glycerol backbone is bound to a phosphate group. The phosphate group is modified by\\r\\nthe addition of an alcohol.\\r\\nA phospholipid has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. The fatty acid chains are hydrophobic and exclude\\r\\nthemselves from water, whereas the phosphate is hydrophilic and interacts with water.\\r\\nCells are surrounded by a membrane, which has a bilayer of phospholipids. The fatty acids of phospholipids face\\r\\ninside, away from water, whereas the phosphate group can face either the outside environment or the inside of the\\r\\ncell, which are both aqueous.\\r\\nSteroids and Waxes\\r\\nUnlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier,steroidshave a ring structure. Although they do not resemble\\r\\nother lipids, they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic. All steroids have four, linked carbon\\r\\nrings and several of them, like cholesterol, have a short tail.\\r\\nCholesterol is a steroid. Cholesterol is mainly synthesized in the liver and is the precursor of many steroid hormones,\\r\\nsuch as testosterone and estradiol. It is also the precursor of vitamins E and K. Cholesterol is the precursor of bile\\r\\nsalts, which help in the breakdown of fats and their subsequent absorption by cells. Although cholesterol is often\\r\\nspoken of in negative terms, it is necessary for the proper functioning of the body. It is a key component of the\\r\\nplasma membranes of animal cells.\\r\\nWaxes are made up of a hydrocarbon chain with an alcohol (–OH) group and a fatty acid. Examples of animal waxes\\r\\ninclude beeswax and lanolin. Plants also have waxes, such as the coating on their leaves, that helps prevent them\\r\\nfrom drying out.\\r\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\r\\nFor an additional perspective on lipids, watch this video abouttypes of fat(http://openstax.org/l/lipids).\\r\\nProteins\\r\\nProteinsare one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of\\r\\nfunctions of all macromolecules. Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in\\r\\ntransport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes. Each cell in a living system may contain\\r\\nthousands of different proteins, each with a unique function. Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. They\\r\\nare all, however, polymers of amino acids, arranged in a linear sequence.\\r\\nThe functions of proteins are very diverse because there are 20 different chemically distinct amino acids that form\\r\\nlong chains, and the amino acids can be in any order. For example, proteins can function as enzymes or hormones.\\r\\nEnzymes, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually\\r\\nproteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) upon which it acts. Enzymes\\r\\ncan function to break molecular bonds, to rearrange bonds, or to form new bonds. An example of an enzyme is\\r\\nsalivary amylase, which breaks down amylose, a component of starch.\\r\\nHormonesare chemical signaling molecules, usually proteins or steroids, secreted by an endocrine gland or group\\r\\nof endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development,\\r\\n2.3 • Biological Molecules               45\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"v0LxoAkJS23rKhA/lTa/ErbVCEtSjeZKH6GDpjccXhQ=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"v0LxoAkJS23rKhA/lTa/ErbVCEtSjeZKH6GDpjccXhQ=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"C3Y4VxA0wrh7ZrNwLTrKkS3XyAaFOepRXaS3r/ejvzU=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nmetabolism, and reproduction.

Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to\\r\\npermanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to a loss of function ordenaturation(to be discussed in\\r\\nmore detail later). All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 kinds of amino acids.\\r\\nAmino acidsare the monomers that make up proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which\\r\\nconsists of a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group (–NH2), a carboxyl group (–COOH), and a hydrogen\\r\\natom. Every amino acid also has another variable atom or group of atoms bonded to the central carbon atom known\\r\\nas the R group. The R group is the only difference in structure between the 20 amino acids; otherwise, the amino\\r\\nacids are identical (Figure 2.20).\\r\\nFIGURE 2.20Amino acids are made up of a central carbon bonded to an amino group (–NH2), a carboxyl group (–COOH), and a hydrogenatom.

Because\\r\\nthis protein’s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years. Protein\\r\\nsequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of sequence similarity among cytochrome c molecules of\\r\\ndifferent species; evolutionary relationships can be assessed by measuring the similarities or differences among\\r\\nvarious species’ protein sequences.\\r\\nFor example, scientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino acids. For each cytochrome\\r\\nc molecule that has been sequenced to date from different organisms, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same\\r\\nposition in each cytochrome c. This indicates that all of these organisms are descended from a common ancestor.\\r\\nOn comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences, no sequence difference was found. When human and\\r\\nrhesus monkey sequences were compared, a single difference was found in one amino acid. In contrast, human-to-\\r\\nyeast comparisons show a difference in 44 amino acids, suggesting that humans and chimpanzees have a more\\r\\nrecent common ancestor than humans and the rhesus monkey, or humans and yeast.\\r\\nProtein Structure\\r\\nAs discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function. To understand how the protein gets its final\\r\\nshape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and\\r\\nquaternary (Figure 2.21).\\r\\nThe unique sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. The unique\\r\\nsequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene that encodes the protein. Any change in the gene\\r\\nsequence may lead to a different amino acid being added to the polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein\\r\\nstructure and function. William Warrick Cardozo showed that sickle-cell anemia is caused by a change in protein\\r\\nstrucure as a result of gene encoding, meaning that it is an inherited disorder. In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin\\r\\nβ chain has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in both the structure and function of the protein.\\r\\nWhat is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta\\r\\nchains that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The\\r\\nstructural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule—that dramatically\\r\\ndecreases life expectancy in the affected individuals—is a single amino acid of the 600.\\r\\nBecause of this change of one amino acid in the chain, the normally biconcave, or disc-shaped, red blood cells\\r\\nassume a crescent or “sickle” shape, which clogs arteries. This can lead to a myriad of serious health problems,\\r\\nsuch as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for those who have this disease.\\r\\nFolding patterns resulting from interactions between the non-R group portions of amino acids give rise to the\\r\\nsecondary structure of the protein. The most common are the alpha (α)-helix and beta (β)-pleated sheet structures.\\r\\nBoth structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds. In the alpha helix, the bonds form between every fourth\\r\\namino acid and cause a twist in the amino acid chain.\\r\\nIn the β-pleated sheet, the “pleats” are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of the\\r\\npolypeptide chain. The R groups are attached to the carbons, and extend above and below the folds of the pleat. The\\r\\npleated segments align parallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the same pairs of atoms on each\\r\\nof the aligned amino acids. The α-helix and β-pleated sheet structures are found in many globular and fibrous\\r\\nproteins.\\r\\nThe unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is known as its tertiary structure. This structure is caused\\r\\nby chemical interactions between various amino acids and regions of the polypeptide. Primarily, the interactions\\r\\namong R groups create the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. There may be ionic bonds\\r\\n2.3 • Biological Molecules               47\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"KVictCjBHOPyU8Te4xm9AIRTxqRACJyOMa54EMWboZw=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"KVictCjBHOPyU8Te4xm9AIRTxqRACJyOMa54EMWboZw=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"VLU1Not2TRkvzycAps8AYlcnwAPHr9Q0Xy5pUf64W4I=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nformed between R groups on different amino acids, or hydrogen bonding beyond that involved in the secondary\\r\\nstructure.

The former types of interactions are also known as\\r\\nhydrophobic interactions.\\r\\nIn nature, some proteins are formed from several polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of these\\r\\nsubunits forms the quaternary structure. Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall\\r\\nstructure. For example, hemoglobin is a combination of four polypeptide subunits.\\r\\nFIGURE 2.21The four levels of protein structure can be observed in these illustrations.

If the protein is subject\\r\\nto changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape in what\\r\\nis known as denaturation as discussed earlier. Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure is\\r\\npreserved if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation\\r\\nis irreversible, leading to a loss of function. One example of protein denaturation can be seen when an egg is fried or\\r\\nboiled. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan, changing from a clear\\r\\nsubstance to an opaque white substance.

Atoms, which consist of\\r\\nprotons, neutrons, and electrons, are the smallest units\\r\\nof an element that retain all of the properties of that\\r\\nelement. Electrons can be donated or shared between\\r\\natoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and\\r\\nhydrogen bonds, as well as van der Waals interactions.\\r\\n2.2Water\\r\\nWater has many properties that are critical to\\r\\nmaintaining life. It is polar, allowing for the formation of\\r\\nhydrogen bonds, which allow ions and other polar\\r\\nmolecules to dissolve in water. Therefore, water is an\\r\\nexcellent solvent. The hydrogen bonds between water\\r\\nmolecules give water the ability to hold heat better\\r\\nthan many other substances. As the temperature rises,\\r\\nthe hydrogen bonds between water continually break\\r\\nand reform, allowing for the overall temperature to\\r\\nremain stable, although increased energy is added to\\r\\nthe system. Water’s cohesive forces allow for the\\r\\nproperty of surface tension. All of these unique\\r\\nproperties of water are important in the chemistry of\\r\\nliving organisms.\\r\\nThe pH of a solution is a measure of the concentration\\r\\nof hydrogen ions in the solution. A solution with a high\\r\\nnumber of hydrogen ions is acidic and has a low pH\\r\\nvalue. A solution with a high number of hydroxide ions\\r\\nis basic and has a high pH value. The pH scale ranges\\r\\nfrom 0 to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral. Buffers are\\r\\nsolutions that moderate pH changes when an acid or\\r\\nbase is added to the buffer system. Buffers are\\r\\nimportant in biological systems because of their ability\\r\\nto maintain constant pH conditions.\\r\\n2.3Biological Molecules\\r\\nLiving things are carbon-based because carbon plays\\r\\nsuch a prominent role in the chemistry of living things.\\r\\nThe four covalent bonding positions of the carbon atom\\r\\ncan give rise to a wide diversity of compounds with\\r\\nmany functions, accounting for the importance of\\r\\n52     2 • Chapter Summary\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"CHRT4i41xTP9m2JcxoeYasYFkTkAV/ORoUXoYrZJJ6A=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"CHRT4i41xTP9m2JcxoeYasYFkTkAV/ORoUXoYrZJJ6A=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"KN6ZmS9ORV8V4rIykXnxqocbiw11udwkxovzvLg7noY=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\ncarbon in living things.

Several systems functioning together form an organism (such as an elephant, for\\r\\nexample).\\r\\nThere are many types of cells, and all are grouped into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic\\r\\nand eukaryotic. Animal cells, plant cells, fungal cells, and protist cells are classified as eukaryotic,\\r\\nwhereas bacteria and archaea cells are classified as prokaryotic. Before discussing the criteria for\\r\\ndetermining whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic, let us first examine how biologists study\\r\\ncells.\\r\\nMicroscopy\\r\\nCells vary in size. With few exceptions, individual cells are too small to be seen with the naked eye,\\r\\nso scientists use microscopes to study them. Amicroscopeis an instrument that magnifies an\\r\\nobject. Most images of cells are taken with a microscope and are called micrographs.\\r\\nLight Microscopes\\r\\nTo give you a sense of the size of a cell, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a\\r\\nmeter or eight micrometers (abbreviated as μm) in diameter; the head of a pin is about two\\r\\nthousandths of a meter (millimeters, or mm) in diameter. That means that approximately 250 red\\r\\nblood cells could fit on the head of a pin.\\r\\nThe optics of the lenses of a light microscope changes the orientation of the image. A specimen\\r\\nthat is right-side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing\\r\\nleft when viewed through a microscope, and vice versa. Similarly, if the slide is moved left while\\r\\nlooking through the microscope, it will appear to move right, and if moved down, it will seem to\\r\\nmove up. This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image. Due to\\r\\nthe manner in which light travels through the lenses, this system of lenses produces an inverted\\r\\nimage (binoculars and a dissecting microscope work in a similar manner, but include an additional\\r\\nmagnification system that makes the final image appear to be upright).\\r\\nMost student microscopes are classified as light microscopes (Figure 3.2a). Visible light both\\r\\npasses through and is bent by the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light\\r\\nmicroscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but since individual cells are generally\\r\\ntransparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special stains.\\r\\nStaining, however, usually kills the cells.\\r\\nLight microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to\\r\\napproximately 400 times. Two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and\\r\\nresolving power. Magnification is the degree of enlargement of an object. Resolving power is the\\r\\nability of a microscope to allow the eye to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate; the\\r\\nhigher the resolution, the closer those two objects can be, and the better the clarity and detail of\\r\\nthe image. When oil immersion lenses are used, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times\\r\\nfor the study of smaller cells, like most prokaryotic cells. Because light entering a specimen from\\r\\nbelow is focused onto the eye of an observer, the specimen can be viewed using light microscopy.\\r\\nFor this reason, for light to pass through a specimen, the sample must be thin or translucent.\\r\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\r\\nFor another perspective on cell size, try theHowBig(http://openstax.org/l/cell_sizes2)interactive.\\r\\nA second type of microscope used in laboratories is the dissecting microscope (Figure 3.2b).\\r\\nThese microscopes have a lower magnification (20 to 80 times the object size) than light\\r\\n56               3 • Cell Structure and Function\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"BAsBe3k/CeY4Sl4muOimLWXxK9/LDKKOonbFd6DPF5U=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"BAsBe3k/CeY4Sl4muOimLWXxK9/LDKKOonbFd6DPF5U=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"djXLEAMSudP7UJIa435vXc+ypjsulRVhbHIMiUXuWnQ=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nmicroscopes and can provide a three-dimensional view of the specimen. Thick objects can be examined with many\\r\\ncomponents in focus at the same time. These microscopes are designed to give a magnified and clear view of tissue\\r\\nstructure as well as the anatomy of the whole organism. Like light microscopes, most modern dissecting\\r\\nmicroscopes are also binocular, meaning that they have two separate lens systems, one for each eye. The lens\\r\\nsystems are separated by a certain distance, and therefore provide a sense of depth in the view of their subject to\\r\\nmake manipulations by hand easier. Dissecting microscopes also have optics that correct the image so that it\\r\\nappears as if being seen by the naked eye and not as an inverted image. The light illuminating a sample under a\\r\\ndissecting microscope typically comes from above the sample, but may also be directed from below.\\r\\nFIGURE 3.2(a) Most light microscopes used in a college biology lab can magnify cells up to approximately 400 times. (b) Dissectingmicroscopes have a lower magnification than light microscopes and are used to examine larger objects, such as tissues.\\r\\nElectron Microscopes\\r\\nIn contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light. Not only\\r\\ndoes this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail (Figure 3.3), it also provides higher resolving power.\\r\\nPreparation of a specimen for viewing under an electron microscope will kill it; therefore, live cells cannot be viewed\\r\\nusing this type of microscopy. In addition, the electron beam moves best in a vacuum, making it impossible to view\\r\\nliving materials.\\r\\nIn a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell’s surface, rendering the\\r\\ndetails of cell surface characteristics by reflection. Cells and other structures are usually coated with a metal like\\r\\ngold. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam is transmitted through the cell and provides details\\r\\nof a cell’s internal structures. As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and\\r\\nexpensive than are light microscopes.\\r\\n3.1 • How Cells Are Studied               57\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"hL+VqO+xF+23WiNjT9Ma/cUc3dgnWuF0Iy5bc6ipL1o=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"hL+VqO+xF+23WiNjT9Ma/cUc3dgnWuF0Iy5bc6ipL1o=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"9gQ192o7Z93tzc6YmJckEJTe3KZ9qrrPmFk9mE8pm58=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 3.3(a)Salmonellabacteria are viewed with a light microscope.

Despite the limitations of his now-ancient lenses, van\\r\\nLeeuwenhoek observed the movements of protists (a type of single-celled organism) and sperm, which he\\r\\ncollectively termed “animalcules.”\\r\\nIn a 1665 publication calledMicrographia, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” (from the\\r\\nLatincella, meaning “small room”) for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens.\\r\\nIn the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa. Later advances in lenses and microscope\\r\\nconstruction enabled other scientists to see different components inside cells.\\r\\nBy the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed\\r\\ntheunified cell theory, which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells, that the cell is the\\r\\nbasic unit of life, and that all new cells arise from existing cells. These principles still stand today.\\r\\n3.2 Comparing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells\\r\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\r\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\r\\n•Name examples of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms\\r\\n•Compare and contrast prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells\\r\\n•Describe the relative sizes of different kinds of cells\\r\\nCells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The predominantly single-celled organisms of\\r\\nthe domains Bacteria and Archaea are classified as prokaryotes (pro- = before; -karyon- = nucleus). Animal cells,\\r\\nplant cells, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes (eu- = true).\\r\\nComponents of Prokaryotic Cells\\r\\nAll cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell’s interior\\r\\nfrom its surrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like region within the cell in which other\\r\\ncellular components are found; 3) DNA, the genetic material of the cell; and 4) ribosomes, particles that synthesize\\r\\nproteins. However, prokaryotes differ from eukaryotic cells in several ways.\\r\\nAprokaryotic cellis a simple, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-\\r\\nbound organelle. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic DNA is\\r\\nfound in the central part of the cell: a darkened region called the nucleoid (Figure 3.5).\\r\\n3.2 • Comparing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells               59\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"ySDiWlYgw0RSAxnc8he4ByXyeYIWM6rwOLtzIYNupMw=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ySDiWlYgw0RSAxnc8he4ByXyeYIWM6rwOLtzIYNupMw=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"gO+VBhcnU0/efw0vjGCM0IZjEIVGdtV7PXnYvFzPXSc=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 3.5This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell.\\r\\nUnlike Archaea and eukaryotes, bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, comprised of sugars and amino\\r\\nacids, and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 3.5). The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps\\r\\nthe cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its\\r\\nenvironment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion, while most pili are\\r\\nused to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation.\\r\\nEukaryotic Cells\\r\\nIn nature, the relationship between form and function is apparent at all levels, including the level of the cell, and this\\r\\nwill become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells. The principle “form follows function” is found in many contexts.\\r\\nFor example, birds and fish have streamlined bodies that allow them to move quickly through the medium in which\\r\\nthey live, be it air or water. It means that, in general, one can deduce the function of a structure by looking at its\\r\\nform, because the two are matched.\\r\\nAeukaryotic cellis a cell that has a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound compartments or sacs,\\r\\ncalledorganelles, which have specialized functions. The word eukaryotic means “true kernel” or “true nucleus,”\\r\\nalluding to the presence of the membrane-bound nucleus in these cells. The word “organelle” means “little organ,”\\r\\nand, as already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as the organs of your body have\\r\\nspecialized functions.\\r\\nCell Size\\r\\nAt 0.1–5.0 μm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters\\r\\nranging from 10–100 μm (Figure 3.6). The small size of prokaryotes allows ions and organic molecules that enter\\r\\nthem to quickly spread to other parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly\\r\\nmove out. However, larger eukaryotic cells have evolved different structural adaptations to enhance cellular\\r\\ntransport. Indeed, the large size of these cells would not be possible without these adaptations. In general, cell size\\r\\nis limited because volume increases much more quickly than does cell surface area. As a cell becomes larger, it\\r\\nbecomes more and more difficult for the cell to acquire sufficient materials to support the processes inside the cell,\\r\\nbecause the relative size of the surface area across which materials must be transported declines.\\r\\n60               3 • Cell Structure and Function\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"gWZ8Bk6JDARNZPVskj6H/dGuBrHTPBM+SrVZLTatMT8=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"gWZ8Bk6JDARNZPVskj6H/dGuBrHTPBM+SrVZLTatMT8=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"RjFfWpPfuxNGXiSa+KhZuAiE5dTq8MMVZNSIx34MIZo=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 3.6This figure shows the relative sizes of different kinds of cells and cellular components.

A\\r\\nphospholipid is a lipid molecule composed of two fatty acid chains, a glycerol backbone, and a phosphate group.\\r\\nThe plasma membrane regulates the passage of some substances, such as organic molecules, ions, and water,\\r\\npreventing the passage of some to maintain internal conditions, while actively bringing in or removing others. Other\\r\\ncompounds move passively across the membrane.\\r\\nFIGURE 3.8The plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins. There are other components, such as cholesteroland carbohydrates, which can be found in the membrane in addition to phospholipids and protein.\\r\\nThe plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption are folded into fingerlike projections called microvilli\\r\\n(singular = microvillus). This folding increases the surface area of the plasma membrane. Such cells are typically\\r\\nfound lining the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. This is an excellent example of\\r\\nform matching the function of a structure.\\r\\nPeople with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.\\r\\nThe immune response damages microvilli, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients. This leads to\\r\\nmalnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet.\\r\\nThe Cytoplasm\\r\\nThecytoplasmcomprises the contents of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (a\\r\\nstructure to be discussed shortly). It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel-likecytosol, the cytoskeleton,\\r\\nand various chemicals (Figure 3.7). Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a semi-\\r\\nsolid consistency, which comes from the proteins within it. However, proteins are not the only organic molecules\\r\\nfound in the cytoplasm. Glucose and other simple sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids,\\r\\nand derivatives of glycerol are found there too. Ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, and many other elements are\\r\\nalso dissolved in the cytoplasm. Many metabolic reactions, including protein synthesis, take place in the cytoplasm.\\r\\nThe Cytoskeleton\\r\\nIf you were to remove all the organelles from a cell, would the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm be the only\\r\\ncomponents left? No. Within the cytoplasm, there would still be ions and organic molecules, plus a network of\\r\\nprotein fibers that helps to maintain the shape of the cell, secures certain organelles in specific positions, allows\\r\\ncytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell, and enables unicellular organisms to move independently.\\r\\nCollectively, this network of protein fibers is known as thecytoskeleton. There are three types of fibers within the\\r\\ncytoskeleton: microfilaments, also known as actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (Figure 3.9).\\r\\n3.3 • Eukaryotic Cells               63\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"Ng5IPDTz54YsrQR0IL4rK0pDBMNOyeruSgNdQs6eaI0=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"Ng5IPDTz54YsrQR0IL4rK0pDBMNOyeruSgNdQs6eaI0=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"wwrjFwT2BmIxa9FRU/UGoEI1q76yaSvzp7muLrm+E0o=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 3.9Microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules compose a cell’s cytoskeleton.\\r\\nMicrofilaments are the thinnest of the cytoskeletal fibers and function in moving cellular components, for example,\\r\\nduring cell division.

These components are also common in muscle cells and are responsible for\\r\\nmuscle cell contraction. Intermediate filaments are of intermediate diameter and have structural functions, such as\\r\\nmaintaining the shape of the cell and anchoring organelles. Keratin, the compound that strengthens hair and nails,\\r\\nforms one type of intermediate filament. Microtubules are the thickest of the cytoskeletal fibers. These are hollow\\r\\ntubes that can dissolve and reform quickly. Microtubules guide organelle movement and are the structures that pull\\r\\nchromosomes to their poles during cell division. They are also the structural components of flagella and cilia. In cilia\\r\\nand flagella, the microtubules are organized as a circle of nine double microtubules on the outside and two\\r\\nmicrotubules in the center.\\r\\nThe centrosome is a region near the nucleus of animal cells that functions as a microtubule-organizing center. It\\r\\ncontains a pair of centrioles, two structures that lie perpendicular to each other.

It includes the nuclear envelope,\\r\\nlysosomes, and vesicles, the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which we will cover shortly. Although not\\r\\ntechnicallywithinthe cell, the plasma membrane is included in the endomembrane system because, as you will see,\\r\\nit interacts with the other endomembranous organelles.\\r\\nThe Nucleus\\r\\nTypically, the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell (Figure 3.7). Thenucleus(plural = nuclei) houses the\\r\\ncell’s DNA in the form of chromatin and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins. Let us look at it in more\\r\\ndetail (Figure 3.10).\\r\\nFIGURE 3.10The outermost boundary of the nucleus is the nuclear envelope. Notice that the nuclear envelope consists of twophospholipid bilayers (membranes)—an outer membrane and an inner membrane—in contrast to the plasma membrane (Figure 3.8), which\\r\\nconsists of only one phospholipid bilayer. (credit: modification of work by NIGMS, NIH)\\r\\nThenuclear envelopeis a double-membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus\\r\\n(Figure 3.10). Both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers.\\r\\nThe nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions, molecules, and RNA between the\\r\\nnucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.\\r\\nTo understandchromatin, it is helpful to first consider chromosomes. Achromosomeis a structure within the\\r\\nnucleus that is made up of DNA, the hereditary material, and proteins. This combination of DNA and proteins is\\r\\ncalled chromatin. In eukaryotes, chromosomes are linear structures. Every species has a specific number of\\r\\nchromosomes in the nucleus of its body cells. For example, in humans, the chromosome number is 46, whereas in\\r\\nfruit flies, the chromosome number is eight.\\r\\nChromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to divide. When\\r\\nthe cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle, the chromosomes resemble an unwound, jumbled\\r\\nbunch of threads.\\r\\nWe already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes, but how does it do this? Some chromosomes\\r\\nhave sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA. A darkly staining area within the nucleus, called thenucleolus\\r\\n(plural = nucleoli), aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that\\r\\nare then transported through the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm.\\r\\nThe Endoplasmic Reticulum\\r\\nTheendoplasmic reticulum (ER)(Figure 3.13) is a series of interconnected membranous tubules that collectively\\r\\nmodify proteins and synthesize lipids. However, these two functions are performed in separate areas of the\\r\\nendoplasmic reticulum: the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.\\r\\nThe hollow portion of the ER tubules is called the lumen or cisternal space.

The RER also\\r\\nmakes phospholipids for cell membranes.\\r\\nIf the phospholipids or modified proteins are not destined to stay in the RER, they will be packaged within vesicles\\r\\nand transported from the RER by budding from the membrane (Figure 3.13). Since the RER is engaged in modifying\\r\\nproteins that will be secreted from the cell, it is abundant in cells that secrete proteins, such as the liver.\\r\\nThesmooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on its\\r\\ncytoplasmic surface (seeFigure 3.7). The SER’s functions include synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids (including\\r\\nphospholipids), and steroid hormones; detoxification of medications and poisons; alcohol metabolism; and storage\\r\\nof calcium ions.\\r\\nThe Golgi Apparatus\\r\\nWe have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER, but where do the vesicles go? Before reaching their\\r\\nfinal destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles need to be sorted, packaged, and tagged so that\\r\\nthey wind up in the right place. The sorting, tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and proteins take place in\\r\\ntheGolgi apparatus(also called the Golgi body), a series of flattened membranous sacs (Figure 3.11).\\r\\nFIGURE 3.11The Golgi apparatus in this transmission electron micrograph of a white blood cell is visible as a stack of semicircularflattened rings in the lower portion of this image. Several vesicles can be seen near the Golgi apparatus. (credit: modification of work by\\r\\nLouisa Howard; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\\r\\nThe Golgi apparatus has a receiving face near the endoplasmic reticulum and a releasing face on the side away from\\r\\nthe ER, toward the cell membrane. The transport vesicles that form from the ER travel to the receiving face, fuse\\r\\nwith it, and empty their contents into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. As the proteins and lipids travel through the\\r\\nGolgi, they undergo further modifications. The most frequent modification is the addition of short chains of sugar\\r\\nmolecules. The newly modified proteins and lipids are then tagged with small molecular groups to enable them to\\r\\nbe routed to their proper destinations.\\r\\nFinally, the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into vesicles that bud from the opposite face of the Golgi.\\r\\nWhile some of these vesicles, transport vesicles, deposit their contents into other parts of the cell where they will be\\r\\nused, others, secretory vesicles, fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell.\\r\\nThe amount of Golgi in different cell types again illustrates that form follows function within cells. Cells that engage\\r\\nin a great deal of secretory activity (such as cells of the salivary glands that secrete digestive enzymes or cells of the\\r\\nimmune system that secrete antibodies) have an abundant number of Golgi.\\r\\nIn plant cells, the Golgi has an additional role of synthesizing polysaccharides, some of which are incorporated into\\r\\nthe cell wall and some of which are used in other parts of the cell.\\r\\nLysosomes\\r\\nIn animal cells, thelysosomesare the cell’s “garbage disposal.” Digestive enzymes within the lysosomes aid the\\r\\nbreakdown of proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and even worn-out organelles.

In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide, water, and light\\r\\nenergy are used to make glucose and oxygen. This is the major difference between plants and animals: Plants\\r\\n(autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like glucose, whereas animals (heterotrophs) must rely on other\\r\\norganisms for their organic compounds or food source.\\r\\nLike mitochondria, chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but within the space enclosed by a chloroplast’s\\r\\ninner membrane is a set of interconnected and stacked, fluid-filled membrane sacs called thylakoids (Figure 3.15).\\r\\nEach stack of thylakoids is called a granum (plural = grana). The fluid enclosed by the inner membrane and\\r\\nsurrounding the grana is called the stroma.\\r\\n3.3 • Eukaryotic Cells               69\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"YvtG7nZkPW+JvqRq+cDpdLmBzT0onzo8fTZVQiZIdAo=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"YvtG7nZkPW+JvqRq+cDpdLmBzT0onzo8fTZVQiZIdAo=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"a3F+v7eKWZc84rH296HnvMMJUxHkoZNturKxE1LRYwI=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 3.15This simplified diagram of a chloroplast shows the outer membrane, inner membrane, thylakoids, grana, and stroma.\\r\\nThe chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which captures the energy of sunlight for\\r\\nphotosynthesis. Like plant cells, photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts. Some bacteria also perform\\r\\nphotosynthesis, but they do not have chloroplasts. Their photosynthetic pigments are located in the thylakoid\\r\\nmembrane within the cell itself.\\r\\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\\r\\nEndosymbiosis\\r\\nWe have mentioned that both mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA and ribosomes. Have you wondered why?\\r\\nStrong evidence points to endosymbiosis as the explanation.\\r\\nSymbiosis is a relationship in which organisms from two separate species live in close association and typically\\r\\nexhibit specific adaptations to each other. Endosymbiosis (endo-= within) is a relationship in which one organism\\r\\nlives inside the other. Endosymbiotic relationships abound in nature. Microbes that produce vitamin K live inside the\\r\\nhuman gut. This relationship is beneficial for us because we are unable to synthesize vitamin K. It is also beneficial\\r\\nfor the microbes because they are protected from other organisms and are provided a stable habitat and abundant\\r\\nfood by living within the large intestine.\\r\\nScientists have long noticed that bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are similar in size and have other similar\\r\\nfeatures. In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists discovered that mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA and\\r\\nribosomes, just as bacteria do. In 1967, Lynn Margulis used microbial evidence in her proposal of endosymbiotic\\r\\ntheory, which indicated that these organelles originated from separate organisms. Although Margulis’s work was\\r\\nmet with resistance, this basic component of this once-revolutionary hypothesis is now widely accepted. Scientists\\r\\nbelieve that host cells and bacteria formed a mutually beneficial endosymbiotic relationship when the host cells\\r\\ningested aerobic bacteria and cyanobacteria but did not destroy them. Through evolution, these ingested bacteria\\r\\nbecame more specialized in their functions, with the aerobic bacteria becoming mitochondria and the\\r\\nphotosynthetic bacteria becoming chloroplasts.\\r\\nThe Central Vacuole\\r\\nPreviously, we mentioned vacuoles as essential components of plant cells. If you look atFigure 3.7, you will see that\\r\\nplant cells each have a large, central vacuole that occupies most of the cell. Thecentral vacuoleplays a key role in\\r\\nregulating the cell’s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions. In plant cells, the liquid inside the\\r\\ncentral vacuole provides turgor pressure, which is the outward pressure caused by the fluid inside the cell. Have you\\r\\never noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days, it wilts? That is because as the water concentration in\\r\\nthe soil becomes lower than the water concentration in the plant, water moves out of the central vacuoles and\\r\\ncytoplasm and into the soil. As the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves the cell wall unsupported. This loss of support\\r\\nto the cell walls of a plant results in the wilted appearance. Additionally, this fluid has a very bitter taste, which\\r\\ndiscourages consumption by insects and animals. The central vacuole also functions to store proteins in developing\\r\\n70               3 • Cell Structure and Function\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"mfL3rfsV/7nJpRAEZioMynIPX7sJYinmtCCGy7I/h70=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"mfL3rfsV/7nJpRAEZioMynIPX7sJYinmtCCGy7I/h70=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"msbFfKpaiNoHUFJtyvl5Wh16H7K4oL1RYCS21DFE5Ns=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nseed cells.\\r\\nExtracellular Matrix of Animal Cells\\r\\nMost animal cells release materials into the extracellular space. The primary components of these materials are\\r\\nglycoproteins and the protein collagen. Collectively, these materials are called theextracellular matrix(Figure\\r\\n3.16).

When the cells\\r\\nlining a blood vessel are damaged, they display a protein receptor called tissue factor. When tissue factor binds with\\r\\nanother factor in the extracellular matrix, it causes platelets to adhere to the wall of the damaged blood vessel,\\r\\nstimulates adjacent smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel to contract (thus constricting the blood vessel), and\\r\\ninitiates a series of steps that stimulate the platelets to produce clotting factors.\\r\\nIntercellular Junctions\\r\\nCells can also communicate with each other by direct contact, referred to as intercellular junctions.

Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in controlled quantities.\\r\\nPlasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly\\r\\nin flux. The plasma membrane must be sufficiently flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white\\r\\nblood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more obvious functions of a\\r\\nplasma membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize\\r\\none another, which is vital as tissues and organs form during early development, and which later plays a role in the\\r\\n“self” versus “non-self” distinction of the immune response.\\r\\nThe plasma membrane also carries receptors, which are attachment sites for specific substances that interact with\\r\\nthe cell. Each receptor is structured to bind with a specific substance. For example, surface receptors of the\\r\\nmembrane create changes in the interior, such as changes in enzymes of metabolic pathways. These metabolic\\r\\npathways might be vital for providing the cell with energy, making specific substances for the cell, or breaking down\\r\\ncellular waste or toxins for disposal. Receptors on the plasma membrane’s exterior surface interact with hormones\\r\\nor neurotransmitters, and allow their messages to be transmitted into the cell. Some recognition sites are used by\\r\\nviruses as attachment points. Although they are highly specific, pathogens like viruses may evolve to exploit\\r\\nreceptors to gain entry to a cell by mimicking the specific substance that the receptor is meant to bind. This\\r\\nspecificity helps to explain why human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or any of the five types of hepatitis viruses\\r\\ninvade only specific cells.\\r\\nFluid Mosaic Model\\r\\nIn 1972, S. J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson proposed a new model of the plasma membrane that, compared to\\r\\nearlier understanding, better explained both microscopic observations and the function of the plasma membrane.\\r\\nThis was called thefluid mosaic model.

The fluid mosaic model describes\\r\\nthe structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components—including phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins,\\r\\nand carbohydrates—in which the components are able to flow and change position, while maintaining the basic\\r\\nintegrity of the membrane. Both phospholipid molecules and embedded proteins are able to diffuse rapidly and\\r\\nlaterally in the membrane. The fluidity of the plasma membrane is necessary for the activities of certain enzymes\\r\\nand transport molecules within the membrane. Plasma membranes range from 5–10 nm thick. As a comparison,\\r\\nhuman red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 μm thick, or approximately 1,000 times\\r\\nthicker than a plasma membrane. (Figure 3.18)\\r\\nFIGURE 3.18The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane structure describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination ofphospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates.\\r\\nThe plasma membrane is made up primarily of a bilayer of phospholipids with embedded proteins, carbohydrates,\\r\\nglycolipids, and glycoproteins, and, in animal cells, cholesterol. The amount of cholesterol in animal plasma\\r\\nmembranes regulates the fluidity of the membrane and changes based on the temperature of the cell’s\\r\\nenvironment. In other words, cholesterol acts as antifreeze in the cell membrane and is more abundant in animals\\r\\nthat live in cold climates.\\r\\nThe main fabric of the membrane is composed of two layers of phospholipid molecules, and the polar ends of these\\r\\nmolecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist’s rendition of the model) (Figure 3.18) are in contact with\\r\\naqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell. Thus, both surfaces of the plasma membrane are hydrophilic. In\\r\\ncontrast, the interior of the membrane, between its two surfaces, is a hydrophobic or nonpolar region because of the\\r\\nfatty acid tails. This region has no attraction for water or other polar molecules.\\r\\nProteins make up the second major chemical component of plasma membranes. Integral proteins are embedded in\\r\\nthe plasma membrane and may span all or part of the membrane. Integral proteins may serve as channels or pumps\\r\\nto move materials into or out of the cell. Peripheral proteins are found on the exterior or interior surfaces of\\r\\nmembranes, attached either to integral proteins or to phospholipid molecules. Both integral and peripheral proteins\\r\\nmay serve as enzymes, as structural attachments for the fibers of the cytoskeleton, or as part of the cell’s\\r\\nrecognition sites.\\r\\nCarbohydrates are the third major component of plasma membranes. They are always found on the exterior surface\\r\\nof cells and are bound either to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids). These\\r\\ncarbohydrate chains may consist of 2–60 monosaccharide units and may be either straight or branched. Along with\\r\\nperipheral proteins, carbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each other.\\r\\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\\r\\nHow Viruses Infect Specific Organs\\r\\nSpecific glycoprotein molecules exposed on the surface of the cell membranes of host cells are exploited by many\\r\\nviruses to infect specific organs.

Most cells expend most of their energy, in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to create and\\r\\nmaintain an uneven distribution of ions on the opposite sides of their membranes. The structure of the plasma\\r\\nmembrane contributes to these functions, but it also presents some problems.\\r\\nThe most direct forms of membrane transport are passive.Passive transportis a naturally occurring phenomenon\\r\\nand does not require the cell to expend energy to accomplish the movement. In passive transport, substances move\\r\\nfrom an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration in a process called diffusion. A physical space\\r\\nin which there is a different concentration of a single substance is said to have aconcentration gradient.\\r\\nSelective Permeability\\r\\nPlasma membranes are asymmetric, meaning that despite the mirror image formed by the phospholipids, the\\r\\ninterior of the membrane is not identical to the exterior of the membrane. Integral proteins that act as channels or\\r\\npumps work in one direction. Carbohydrates, attached to lipids or proteins, are also found on the exterior surface of\\r\\nthe plasma membrane. These carbohydrate complexes help the cell bind substances that the cell needs in the\\r\\nextracellular fluid. This adds considerably to the selective nature of plasma membranes.\\r\\nRecall that plasma membranes have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. This characteristic helps the movement\\r\\nof certain materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. Lipid-soluble material can easily\\r\\nslip through the hydrophobic lipid core of the membrane. Substances such as the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K\\r\\nreadily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues. Fat-soluble drugs also gain\\r\\neasy entry into cells and are readily transported into the body’s tissues and organs. Molecules of oxygen and carbon\\r\\ndioxide have no charge and pass through by simple diffusion.\\r\\nPolar substances present problems for the membrane. While some polar molecules connect easily with the outside\\r\\nof a cell, they cannot readily pass through the lipid core of the plasma membrane. Additionally, whereas small ions\\r\\ncould easily slip through the spaces in the mosaic of the membrane, their charge prevents them from doing so. Ions\\r\\nsuch as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride must have a special means of penetrating plasma membranes.\\r\\nSimple sugars and amino acids also need help with transport across plasma membranes.\\r\\nDiffusion\\r\\nDiffusionis a passive process of transport. A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to\\r\\nan area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across the space. You are familiar with diffusion of\\r\\nsubstances through the air. For example, think about someone opening a bottle of perfume in a room filled with\\r\\npeople. The perfume is at its highest concentration in the bottle and is at its lowest at the edges of the room. The\\r\\nperfume vapor will diffuse, or spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more and more people will smell the\\r\\nperfume as it spreads. Materials move within the cell’s cytosol by diffusion, and certain materials move through the\\r\\nplasma membrane by diffusion (Figure 3.20). Diffusion expends no energy. Rather the different concentrations of\\r\\nmaterials in different areas are a form of potential energy, and diffusion is the dissipation of that potential energy as\\r\\nmaterials move down their concentration gradients, from high to low.\\r\\nFIGURE 3.20Diffusion through a permeable membrane follows the concentration gradient of a substance, moving the substance from anarea of high concentration to one of low concentration.

The solution to moving polar substances and other\\r\\nsubstances across the plasma membrane rests in the proteins that span its surface. The material being transported\\r\\nis first attached to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. This allows\\r\\nthe material that is needed by the cell to be removed from the extracellular fluid. The substances are then passed to\\r\\nspecific integral proteins that facilitate their passage, because they form channels or pores that allow certain\\r\\nsubstances to pass through the membrane. The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively\\r\\nreferred to as transport proteins, and they function as either channels for the material or carriers.\\r\\nOsmosis\\r\\nOsmosisis the movement of free water molecules through a semipermeable membrane according to the water's\\r\\nconcentration gradient across the membrane, which is inversely proportional to the solutes' concentration. Whereas\\r\\ndiffusion transports material across membranes and within cells, osmosis transportsonly wateracross a membrane\\r\\nand the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water. Osmosis is a special case of diffusion. Water, like\\r\\nother substances, moves from an area of high concentration of free water molecules to one of low free water\\r\\nmolecule concentration. Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane, separating the two sides or halves\\r\\n(Figure 3.21). On both sides of the membrane, the water level is the same, but there are different concentrations on\\r\\neach side of a dissolved substance, orsolute, that cannot cross the membrane. If the volume of the water is the\\r\\nsame, but the concentrations of solute are different, then there are also different concentrations of water, the\\r\\nsolvent, on either side of the membrane.\\r\\n78               3 • Cell Structure and Function\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"MS7s9/W5M62qr8Qwb3foFs/VSLWyWjDXWsk3uOLfxSo=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"MS7s9/W5M62qr8Qwb3foFs/VSLWyWjDXWsk3uOLfxSo=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"4FTunpFHm+wxFI31QuciNPvY6SDR9vrBvuY8t71C4lY=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nFIGURE 3.21In osmosis, water always moves from an area of higher concentration (of water) to one of lower concentration (of water).

The measure of the tonicity of a solution, or the total amount\\r\\nof solutes dissolved in a specific amount of solution, is called itsosmolarity. Three terms—hypotonic, isotonic, and\\r\\nhypertonic—are used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid that contains the\\r\\ncells. In ahypotonicsolution, such as tap water, the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes than the\\r\\nfluid inside the cell, and water enters the cell. (In living systems, the point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so\\r\\nthe prefixhypo- means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes, or a lower osmolarity, than\\r\\nthe cell cytoplasm.) It also means that the extracellular fluid has a higher concentration of water than does the cell.\\r\\nIn this situation, water will follow its concentration gradient and enter the cell.

Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular microorganisms. You might have\\r\\ncorrectly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires energy. A large particle,\\r\\nhowever, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell.\\r\\nElectrochemical Gradient\\r\\nWe have discussed simple concentration gradients—differential concentrations of a substance across a space or a\\r\\nmembrane—but in living systems, gradients are more complex. Because cells contain proteins, most of which are\\r\\nnegatively charged, and because ions move into and out of cells, there is an electrical gradient, a difference of\\r\\ncharge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the\\r\\nextracellular fluid in which they are bathed; at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K+)\\r\\nand lower concentrations of sodium (Na+) than does the extracellular fluid. Thus, in a living cell, the concentration\\r\\ngradient and electrical gradient of Na+promotes diffusion of the ion into the cell, and the electrical gradient of Na+\\r\\n(a positive ion) tends to drive it inward to the negatively charged interior. The situation is more complex, however, for\\r\\nother elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of K+promotes diffusion of the ionintothe cell, but the\\r\\nconcentration gradient of K+promotes diffusionoutof the cell (Figure 3.24). The combined gradient that affects an\\r\\nion is called itselectrochemical gradient, and it is especially important to muscle and nerve cells.\\r\\nFIGURE 3.24Electrochemical gradients arise from the combined effects of concentration gradients and electrical gradients. Na+ions are athigher concentration outside the cell, and K+ions are at higher concentration inside of the cell, and yet the inside of the cell has negative\\r\\nnet charge compared to the other side of the membrane. This is due to the presence of K+binding proteins and other negatively chargedmolecules. The difference in electrical charges attracts the positively charged Na ions toward the inside of the cell, the electrical gradient,\\r\\nwhile the K ions tend to flow through K channels toward the outside of the cell due to the concentration difference, the concentrationgradient. (credit: modification of work by “Synaptitude”/Wikimedia Commons)\\r\\nMoving Against a Gradient\\r\\nTo move substances against a concentration or an electrochemical gradient, the cell must use energy. This energy is\\r\\nharvested from ATP that is generated through cellular metabolism. Active transport mechanisms, collectively called\\r\\npumps or carrier proteins, work against electrochemical gradients. With the exception of ions, small substances\\r\\nconstantly pass through plasma membranes. Active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other\\r\\nsubstances needed by living cells in the face of these passive changes. Much of a cell’s supply of metabolic energy\\r\\nmay be spent maintaining these processes. Because active transport mechanisms depend on cellular metabolism\\r\\nfor energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the supply of ATP.\\r\\nTwo mechanisms exist for the transport of small-molecular weight material and macromolecules. Primary active\\r\\ntransport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane.

They perform protein\\r\\nsynthesis. Mitochondria perform cellular respiration\\r\\nand produce ATP. Peroxisomes break down fatty acids,\\r\\namino acids, and some toxins. Vesicles and vacuoles\\r\\nare storage and transport compartments. In plant cells,\\r\\nvacuoles also help break down macromolecules.\\r\\nAnimal cells also have a centrosome and lysosomes.\\r\\nThe centrosome has two bodies, the centrioles, with an\\r\\nunknown role in cell division. Lysosomes are the\\r\\ndigestive organelles of animal cells.\\r\\nPlant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a central\\r\\nvacuole. The plant cell wall, whose primary component\\r\\nis cellulose, protects the cell, provides structural\\r\\nsupport, and gives shape to the cell. Photosynthesis\\r\\ntakes place in chloroplasts. The central vacuole\\r\\nexpands, enlarging the cell without the need to\\r\\nproduce more cytoplasm.\\r\\nThe endomembrane system includes the nuclear\\r\\nenvelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus,\\r\\nlysosomes, vesicles, as well as the plasma membrane.\\r\\nThese cellular components work together to modify,\\r\\npackage, tag, and transport membrane lipids and\\r\\nproteins.\\r\\nThe cytoskeleton has three different types of protein\\r\\nelements. Microfilaments provide rigidity and shape to\\r\\nthe cell, and facilitate cellular movements.\\r\\nIntermediate filaments bear tension and anchor the\\r\\nnucleus and other organelles in place. Microtubules\\r\\nhelp the cell resist compression, serve as tracks for\\r\\nmotor proteins that move vesicles through the cell, and\\r\\npull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a\\r\\ndividing cell. They are also the structural elements of\\r\\ncentrioles, flagella, and cilia.\\r\\nAnimal cells communicate through their extracellular\\r\\nmatrices and are connected to each other by tight\\r\\njunctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions. Plant cells\\r\\nare connected and communicate with each other by\\r\\nplasmodesmata.\\r\\n3.4The Cell Membrane\\r\\nThe modern understanding of the plasma membrane is\\r\\nreferred to as the fluid mosaic model. The plasma\\r\\nmembrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids,\\r\\nwith their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with\\r\\neach other. The landscape of the membrane is studded\\r\\nwith proteins, some of which span the membrane.\\r\\nSome of these proteins serve to transport materials\\r\\ninto or out of the cell. Carbohydrates are attached to\\r\\nsome of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing\\r\\nsurface of the membrane. These form complexes that\\r\\nfunction to identify the cell to other cells. The fluid\\r\\nnature of the membrane owes itself to the\\r\\nconfiguration of the fatty acid tails, the presence of\\r\\ncholesterol embedded in the membrane (in animal\\r\\ncells), and the mosaic nature of the proteins and\\r\\nprotein-carbohydrate complexes, which are not firmly\\r\\nfixed in place. Plasma membranes enclose the borders\\r\\nof cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are\\r\\ndynamic and constantly in flux.\\r\\n3.5Passive Transport\\r\\nThe passive forms of transport, diffusion and osmosis,\\r\\nmove material of small molecular weight. Substances\\r\\ndiffuse from areas of high concentration to areas of low\\r\\nconcentration, and this process continues until the\\r\\nsubstance is evenly distributed in a system. In\\r\\nsolutions of more than one substance, each type of\\r\\nmolecule diffuses according to its own concentration\\r\\ngradient. Many factors can affect the rate of diffusion,\\r\\nincluding concentration gradient, the sizes of the\\r\\nparticles that are diffusing, and the temperature of the\\r\\nsystem.\\r\\nIn living systems, diffusion of substances into and out\\r\\nof cells is mediated by the plasma membrane. Some\\r\\nmaterials diffuse readily through the membrane, but\\r\\nothers are hindered, and their passage is only made\\r\\npossible by protein channels and carriers. The\\r\\nchemistry of living things occurs in aqueous solutions,\\r\\nand balancing the concentrations of those solutions is\\r\\nan ongoing problem. In living systems, diffusion of\\r\\nsome substances would be slow or difficult without\\r\\nmembrane proteins.\\r\\n3.6Active Transport\\r\\nThe combined gradient that affects an ion includes its\\r\\nconcentration gradient and its electrical gradient.\\r\\nLiving cells need certain substances in concentrations\\r\\ngreater than they exist in the extracellular space.\\r\\nMoving substances up their electrochemical gradients\\r\\nrequires energy from the cell. Active transport uses\\r\\nenergy stored in ATP to fuel the transport. Active\\r\\ntransport of small molecular-size material uses integral\\r\\nproteins in the cell membrane to move the\\r\\nmaterial—these proteins are analogous to pumps.\\r\\nSome pumps, which carry out primary active transport,\\r\\n86     3 • Chapter Summary\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"2aHSc3mrzKTeCdj6TBy4TuzUbWLPKDp2xoy8sk9OAQg=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2aHSc3mrzKTeCdj6TBy4TuzUbWLPKDp2xoy8sk9OAQg=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"lIaeZ8KRx8HaKts4X3D/xiiSlojdgCaWalI5g0J0New=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\ncouple directly with ATP to drive their action.

Energy is\\r\\nneeded to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use energy while thinking, and even\\r\\nduring sleep. In fact, the living cells of every organism constantly use energy. Nutrients and other\\r\\nmolecules are imported into the cell, metabolized (broken down) and possibly synthesized into\\r\\nnew molecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and possibly distributed to the\\r\\nentire organism. For example, the large proteins that make up muscles are built from smaller\\r\\nmolecules imported from dietary amino acids. Complex carbohydrates are broken down into\\r\\nsimple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a\\r\\nbuilding, energy is required for the synthesis and breakdown of molecules as well as the transport\\r\\nof molecules into and out of cells. In addition, processes such as ingesting and breaking down\\r\\npathogenic bacteria and viruses, exporting wastes and toxins, and movement of the cell require\\r\\nenergy. From where, and in what form, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain energy,\\r\\nand how do they use it?

During\\r\\nthe light reactions of photosynthesis, energy is provided by a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which\\r\\nis the primary energy currency of all cells. Just as the dollar is used as currency to buy goods, cells use molecules of\\r\\nATP as energy currency to perform immediate work. In contrast, energy-storage molecules such as glucose are\\r\\nconsumed only to be broken down to use their energy. The reaction that harvests the energy of a sugar molecule in\\r\\ncells requiring oxygen to survive can be summarized by the reverse reaction to photosynthesis. In this reaction,\\r\\noxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. The reaction is summarized as:\\r\\nBoth of these reactions involve many steps.\\r\\nThe processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two examples of metabolic pathways. A\\r\\nmetabolic pathway is a series of chemical reactions that takes a starting molecule and modifies it, step-by-step,\\r\\nthrough a series of metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product. In the example of sugar metabolism,\\r\\nthe first metabolic pathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pathway broke sugar down\\r\\ninto smaller molecules. These two opposite processes—the first requiring energy and the second producing\\r\\nenergy—are referred to asanabolicpathways (building polymers) andcatabolicpathways (breaking down polymers\\r\\ninto their monomers), respectively. Consequently, metabolism is composed of synthesis (anabolism) and\\r\\ndegradation (catabolism) (Figure 4.3).\\r\\nIt is important to know that the chemical reactions of metabolic pathways do not take place on their own. Each\\r\\nreaction step is facilitated, or catalyzed, by a protein called an enzyme. Enzymes are important for catalyzing all\\r\\ntypes of biological reactions—those that require energy as well as those that release energy.\\r\\nFIGURE 4.3Catabolic pathways are those that generate energy by breaking down larger molecules. Anabolic pathways are those thatrequire energy to synthesize larger molecules. Both types of pathways are required for maintaining the cell’s energy balance.\\r\\nEnergy\\r\\nThermodynamicsrefers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. The matter relevant to\\r\\na particular case of energy transfer is called a system, and everything outside of that matter is called the\\r\\nsurroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the\\r\\nwater. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems:\\r\\nopen and closed. In an open system, energy can be exchanged with its surroundings. The stovetop system is open\\r\\nbecause heat can be lost to the air. A closed system cannot exchange energy with its surroundings.\\r\\nBiological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings as they use\\r\\nenergy from the sun to perform photosynthesis or consume energy-storing molecules and release energy to the\\r\\nenvironment by doing work and releasing heat. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to physical\\r\\nlaws. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe.\\r\\nIn general, energy is defined as the ability to do work, or to create some kind of change.

Sharon Pruitt; credit \\\"kids\\\": modification of\\r\\nwork by Max from Providence; credit \\\"leaf\\\": modification of work by Cory Zanker)\\r\\nA living cell’s primary tasks of obtaining, transforming, and using energy to do work may seem simple. However, the\\r\\nsecond law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. All energy transfers and\\r\\ntransformations are never completely efficient. In every energy transfer, some amount of energy is lost in a form that\\r\\nis unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy. Thermodynamically,heat energyis defined as the energy\\r\\ntransferred from one system to another that is not work. For example, when a light bulb is turned on, some of the\\r\\nenergy being converted from electrical energy into light energy is lost as heat energy. Likewise, some energy is lost\\r\\nas heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions.\\r\\nAn important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder. The more energy that is lost by a system to\\r\\nits surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system is. Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or\\r\\ndisorder within a system as entropy. High entropy means high disorder and low energy. Molecules and chemical\\r\\nreactions have varying entropy as well. For example, entropy increases as molecules at a high concentration in one\\r\\nplace diffuse and spread out. The second law of thermodynamics says that energy will always be lost as heat in\\r\\nenergy transfers or transformations.\\r\\nLiving things are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to be maintained in a state of low entropy.\\r\\nPotential and Kinetic Energy\\r\\nWhen an object is in motion, there is energy associated with that object. Think of a wrecking ball. Even a slow-\\r\\nmoving wrecking ball can do a great deal of damage to other objects. Energy associated with objects in motion is\\r\\ncalledkinetic energy(Figure 4.5). A speeding bullet, a walking person, and the rapid movement of molecules in the\\r\\nair (which produces heat) all have kinetic energy.\\r\\nNow what if that same motionless wrecking ball is lifted two stories above ground with a crane? If the suspended\\r\\nwrecking ball is unmoving, is there energy associated with it? The answer is yes. The energy that was required to lift\\r\\nthe wrecking ball did not disappear, but is now stored in the wrecking ball by virtue of its position and the force of\\r\\ngravity acting on it. This type of energy is calledpotential energy(Figure 4.5). If the ball were to fall, the potential\\r\\nenergy would be transformed into kinetic energy until all of the potential energy was exhausted when the ball rested\\r\\non the ground. Wrecking balls also swing like a pendulum; through the swing, there is a constant change of potential\\r\\nenergy (highest at the top of the swing) to kinetic energy (highest at the bottom of the swing). Other examples of\\r\\npotential energy include the energy of water held behind a dam or a person about to skydive out of an airplane.\\r\\nFIGURE 4.5Still water has potential energy; moving water, such as in a waterfall or a rapidly flowing river, has kinetic energy.

On a\\r\\nmolecular level, the bonds that hold the atoms of molecules together exist in a particular structure that has\\r\\npotential energy.

The type of potential energy that\\r\\nexists within chemical bonds, and is released when those bonds are broken, is called chemical energy.

A measurement of free\\r\\nenergy is used to quantify these energy transfers. Recall that according to the second law of thermodynamics, all\\r\\nenergy transfers involve the loss of some amount of energy in an unusable form such as heat. Free energy\\r\\nspecifically refers to the energy associated with a chemical reaction that is available after the losses are accounted\\r\\nfor. In other words, free energy is usable energy, or energy that is available to do work.\\r\\nIf energy is released during a chemical reaction, then the change in free energy, signified as ∆G (delta G) will be a\\r\\nnegative number. A negative change in free energy also means that the products of the reaction have less free\\r\\nenergy than the reactants, because they release some free energy during the reaction. Reactions that have a\\r\\nnegative change in free energy and consequently release free energy are calledexergonic reactions. Think:\\r\\nexergonic means energy isexiting the system. These reactions are also referred to as spontaneous reactions, and\\r\\ntheir products have less stored energy than the reactants. An important distinction must be drawn between the\\r\\nterm spontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction occurring immediately. Contrary to the everyday use of the\\r\\nterm, a spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs. The rusting of iron is an example of a\\r\\nspontaneous reaction that occurs slowly, little by little, over time.\\r\\nIf a chemical reaction absorbs energy rather than releases energy on balance, then the ∆G for that reaction will be a\\r\\npositive value. In this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants. Thus, the products of these\\r\\nreactions can be thought of as energy-storing molecules. These chemical reactions are calledendergonic reactions\\r\\nand they are non-spontaneous. An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free\\r\\nenergy.\\r\\n94               4 • How Cells Obtain Energy\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"4CKOVbcIgc+GryTpWL7Zl21UVPxrIERQqPOfTpwqhcs=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4CKOVbcIgc+GryTpWL7Zl21UVPxrIERQqPOfTpwqhcs=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"wSeEUsTAb1XuD1SgzOoaFj90psVgKVoaC8RpfzrA6zk=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nVISUAL CONNECTION\\r\\nFIGURE 4.6Shown are some examples of endergonic processes (ones that require energy) and exergonic processes (ones that releaseenergy).

It is important to remember that enzymes\\r\\ndo not change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or endergonic. This is because they do not change the\\r\\nfree energy of the reactants or products. They only reduce the activation energy required for the reaction to go\\r\\nforward (Figure 4.7). In addition, an enzyme itself is unchanged by the reaction it catalyzes. Once one reaction has\\r\\nbeen catalyzed, the enzyme is able to participate in other reactions.\\r\\nFIGURE 4.7Enzymes lower the activation energy of the reaction but do not change the free energy of the reaction.\\r\\nThe chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are called the enzyme’ssubstrates. There may be one or more\\r\\nsubstrates, depending on the particular chemical reaction. In some reactions, a single reactant substrate is broken\\r\\ndown into multiple products. In others, two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule. Two\\r\\nreactants might also enter a reaction and both become modified, but they leave the reaction as two products. The\\r\\nlocation within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzyme’sactive site. The active site is where the\\r\\n“action” happens. Since enzymes are proteins, there is a unique combination of amino acid side chains within the\\r\\nactive site. Each side chain is characterized by different properties. They can be large or small, weakly acidic or\\r\\nbasic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, positively or negatively charged, or neutral. The unique combination of side\\r\\nchains creates a very specific chemical environment within the active site. This specific environment is suited to\\r\\nbind to one specific chemical substrate (or substrates).\\r\\nActive sites are subject to influences of the local environment. Increasing the environmental temperature generally\\r\\nincreases reaction rates, enzyme-catalyzed or otherwise. However, temperatures outside of an optimal range\\r\\nreduce the rate at which an enzyme catalyzes a reaction. Hot temperatures will eventually cause enzymes to\\r\\ndenature, an irreversible change in the three-dimensional shape and therefore the function of the enzyme. Enzymes\\r\\nare also suited to function best within a certain pH and salt concentration range, and, as with temperature, extreme\\r\\npH, and salt concentrations can cause enzymes to denature.\\r\\nFor many years, scientists thought that enzyme-substrate binding took place in a simple “lock and key” fashion.\\r\\nThis model asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step. However,\\r\\ncurrent research supports a model called induced fit (Figure 4.8). The induced-fit model expands on the lock-and-\\r\\nkey model by describing a more dynamic binding between enzyme and substrate.

This complex lowers the activation\\r\\nenergy of the reaction and promotes its rapid progression in one of multiple possible ways. On a basic level,\\r\\nenzymes promote chemical reactions that involve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an\\r\\noptimal orientation for reaction. Another way in which enzymes promote the reaction of their substrates is by\\r\\ncreating an optimal environment within the active site for the reaction to occur. The chemical properties that emerge\\r\\nfrom the particular arrangement of amino acid R groups within an active site create the perfect environment for an\\r\\nenzyme’s specific substrates to react.\\r\\nThe enzyme-substrate complex can also lower activation energy by compromising the bond structure so that it is\\r\\neasier to break. Finally, enzymes can also lower activation energies by taking part in the chemical reaction itself. In\\r\\nthese cases, it is important to remember that the enzyme will always return to its original state by the completion of\\r\\nthe reaction. One of the hallmark properties of enzymes is that they remain ultimately unchanged by the reactions\\r\\nthey catalyze. After an enzyme has catalyzed a reaction, it releases its product(s) and can catalyze a new reaction.\\r\\nFIGURE 4.8The induced-fit model is an adjustment to the lock-and-key model and explains how enzymes and substrates undergo dynamicmodifications during the transition state to increase the affinity of the substrate for the active site.\\r\\nIt would seem ideal to have a scenario in which all of an organism's enzymes existed in abundant supply and\\r\\nfunctioned optimally under all cellular conditions, in all cells, at all times. However, a variety of mechanisms ensures\\r\\nthat this does not happen. Cellular needs and conditions constantly vary from cell to cell, and change within\\r\\nindividual cells over time. The required enzymes of stomach cells differ from those of fat storage cells, skin cells,\\r\\nblood cells, and nerve cells. Furthermore, a digestive organ cell works much harder to process and break down\\r\\nnutrients during the time that closely follows a meal compared with many hours after a meal. As these cellular\\r\\ndemands and conditions vary, so must the amounts and functionality of different enzymes.\\r\\nSince the rates of biochemical reactions are controlled by activation energy, and enzymes lower and determine\\r\\nactivation energies for chemical reactions, the relative amounts and functioning of the variety of enzymes within a\\r\\ncell ultimately determine which reactions will proceed and at what rates. This determination is tightly controlled in\\r\\ncells. In certain cellular environments, enzyme activity is partly controlled by environmental factors like pH,\\r\\ntemperature, salt concentration, and, in some cases, cofactors or coenzymes.\\r\\nEnzymes can also be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce enzyme activity. There are many kinds of\\r\\nmolecules that inhibit or promote enzyme function, and various mechanisms by which they do so. In some cases of\\r\\nenzyme inhibition, an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply\\r\\nblock the substrate from binding. When this happens, the enzyme is inhibited throughcompetitive inhibition,\\r\\nbecause an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for binding to the active site.\\r\\nOn the other hand, innoncompetitive inhibition, an inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than\\r\\nthe active site, called an allosteric site, but still manages to prevent substrate binding to the active site. Some\\r\\ninhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces\\r\\nthe enzyme activity as it no longer effectively catalyzes the conversion of the substrate to product. This type of\\r\\ninhibition is calledallosteric inhibition(Figure 4.9). Most allosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more\\r\\nthan one polypeptide, meaning that they have more than one protein subunit.

(credit: Deborah Austin)\\r\\nEnzymes are key components of metabolic pathways. Understanding how enzymes work and how they can be\\r\\nregulated are key principles behind the development of many of the pharmaceutical drugs on the market today.\\r\\nBiologists working in this field collaborate with other scientists to design drugs (Figure 4.10).\\r\\nConsider statins for example—statins is the name given to one class of drugs that can reduce cholesterol levels.\\r\\nThese compounds are inhibitors of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is the enzyme that synthesizes\\r\\ncholesterol from lipids in the body. By inhibiting this enzyme, the level of cholesterol synthesized in the body can be\\r\\nreduced. Similarly, acetaminophen, popularly marketed under the brand name Tylenol, is an inhibitor of the enzyme\\r\\ncyclooxygenase. While it is used to provide relief from fever and inflammation (pain), its mechanism of action is still\\r\\nnot completely understood.\\r\\nHow are drugs discovered? One of the biggest challenges in drug discovery is identifying a drug target. A drug target\\r\\nis a molecule that is literally the target of the drug. In the case of statins, HMG-CoA reductase is the drug target.\\r\\nDrug targets are identified through painstaking research in the laboratory.

Binding to these molecules promotes optimal shape and function of their respective enzymes. Two examples\\r\\nof these types of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes. Cofactors are inorganic ions such as ions of iron\\r\\nand magnesium. Coenzymes are organic helper molecules, those with a basic atomic structure made up of carbon\\r\\nand hydrogen. Like enzymes, these molecules participate in reactions without being changed themselves and are\\r\\nultimately recycled and reused. Vitamins are the source of coenzymes. Some vitamins are the precursors of\\r\\ncoenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes. Vitamin C is a direct coenzyme for multiple enzymes that take part\\r\\nin building the important connective tissue, collagen. Therefore, enzyme function is, in part, regulated by the\\r\\nabundance of various cofactors and coenzymes, which may be supplied by an organism’s diet or, in some cases,\\r\\nproduced by the organism.\\r\\nFeedback Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways\\r\\nMolecules can regulate enzyme function in many ways. The major question remains, however: What are these\\r\\nmolecules and where do they come from? Some are cofactors and coenzymes, as you have learned. What other\\r\\nmolecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation such as allosteric modulation, and competitive and non-\\r\\ncompetitive inhibition? Perhaps the most relevant sources of regulatory molecules, with respect to enzymatic\\r\\ncellular metabolism, are the products of the cellular metabolic reactions themselves. In a most efficient and elegant\\r\\nway, cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity.\\r\\nFeedback inhibitioninvolves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further production (Figure 4.11). The\\r\\ncell responds to an abundance of the products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic reactions.\\r\\nSuch reaction products may inhibit the enzymes that catalyzed their production through the mechanisms described\\r\\nabove.\\r\\nFIGURE 4.11Metabolic pathways are a series of reactions catalyzed by multiple enzymes. Feedback inhibition, where the end product ofthe pathway inhibits an upstream process, is an important regulatory mechanism in cells.\\r\\nThe production of both amino acids and nucleotides is controlled through feedback inhibition. Additionally, ATP is an\\r\\nallosteric regulator of some of the enzymes involved in the catabolic breakdown of sugar, the process that creates\\r\\nATP. In this way, when ATP is in abundant supply, the cell can prevent the production of ATP. On the other hand, ADP\\r\\nserves as a positive allosteric regulator (an allosteric activator) for some of the same enzymes that are inhibited by\\r\\nATP. Thus, when relative levels of ADP are high compared to ATP, the cell is triggered to produce more ATP through\\r\\nsugar catabolism.\\r\\n4.1 • Energy and Metabolism               99\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"N0sYAxhbrYEGBr6c49Dlxu0z1lsQDF9rpH5haqeWcrU=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"N0sYAxhbrYEGBr6c49Dlxu0z1lsQDF9rpH5haqeWcrU=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"yxbSIVh2lPS/u7dBqpg25KKG+VpVT4PfdrYF67eyEqU=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\n4.2 Glycolysis\\r\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\r\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\r\\n•Explain how ATP is used by the cell as an energy source\\r\\n•Describe the overall result in terms of molecules produced of the breakdown of glucose by glycolysis\\r\\nEven exergonic, energy-releasing reactions require a small amount of activation energy to proceed.

Within the cell, where does energy to power such reactions come from? The answer lies\\r\\nwith an energy-supplying molecule called adenosine triphosphate, orATP. ATP is a small, relatively simple\\r\\nmolecule, but within its bonds contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform\\r\\ncellular work. This molecule can be thought of as the primary energy currency of cells in the same way that money is\\r\\nthe currency that people exchange for things they need. ATP is used to power the majority of energy-requiring\\r\\ncellular reactions.\\r\\nATP in Living Systems\\r\\nA living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy. Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in\\r\\nthe cell, which would denature enzymes and other proteins, and thus destroy the cell. Rather, a cell must be able to\\r\\nstore energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells accomplish this using ATP, which can be used\\r\\nto fill any energy need of the cell. How? It functions as a rechargeable battery.\\r\\nWhen ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released.

Ribose is a five-carbon sugar found in\\r\\nRNA and AMP is one of the nucleotides in RNA. The addition of a second phosphate group to this core molecule\\r\\nresults in adenosinediphosphate (ADP); the addition of a third phosphate group forms adenosinetriphosphate\\r\\n(ATP).\\r\\nFIGURE 4.12The structure of ATP shows the basic components of a two-ring adenine, five-carbon ribose, and three phosphate groups.\\r\\nThe addition of a phosphate group to a molecule requires a high amount of energy and results in a high-energy\\r\\nbond.

The eight steps of the cycle are a series of chemical reactions that produces two\\r\\ncarbon dioxide molecules, one ATP molecule (or an equivalent), and reduced forms (NADH and FADH2) of NAD+and\\r\\nFAD+, important coenzymes in the cell. Part of this is considered an aerobic pathway (oxygen-requiring) because the\\r\\nNADH and FADH2produced must transfer their electrons to the next pathway in the system, which will use oxygen.\\r\\nIf oxygen is not present, this transfer does not occur.\\r\\nTwo carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group.

The two acetyl-carbon atoms will eventually be released on later turns of the\\r\\ncycle; in this way, all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule will be eventually released as carbon\\r\\ndioxide. It takes two turns of the cycle to process the equivalent of one glucose molecule. Each turn of the cycle\\r\\nforms three high-energy NADH molecules and one high-energy FADH2molecule. These high-energy carriers will\\r\\nconnect with the last portion of aerobic respiration to produce ATP molecules. One ATP (or an equivalent) is also\\r\\nmade in each cycle.

Most of the ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose, however, is not generated directly from\\r\\nthese pathways. Rather, it derives from a process that begins with passing electrons through a series of chemical\\r\\nreactions to a final electron acceptor, oxygen. These reactions take place in specialized protein complexes located in\\r\\nthe inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic organisms and on the inner part of the cell membrane of\\r\\nprokaryotic organisms. The energy of the electrons is harvested and used to generate an electrochemical gradient\\r\\nacross the inner mitochondrial membrane. The potential energy of this gradient is used to generate ATP. The entirety\\r\\nof this process is calledoxidative phosphorylation.\\r\\nThe electron transport chain (Figure 4.15a) is the last component of aerobic respiration and is the only part of\\r\\nmetabolism that uses atmospheric oxygen. Oxygen continuously diffuses into plants for this purpose. In animals,\\r\\noxygen enters the body through the respiratory system. Electron transport is a series of chemical reactions that\\r\\nresembles a bucket brigade in that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the next, to the endpoint of\\r\\nthe chain where oxygen is the final electron acceptor and water is produced.

The uneven distribution of H+ions across the membrane establishes an electrochemical\\r\\ngradient, owing to the H+ions’ positive charge and their higher concentration on one side of the membrane.\\r\\nHydrogen ions diffuse through the inner membrane through an integral membrane protein calledATP synthase\\r\\n(Figure 4.15b). This complex protein acts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing\\r\\nthrough it, down their electrochemical gradient from the intermembrane space, where there are many mutually\\r\\nrepelling hydrogen ions to the matrix, where there are few. The turning of the parts of this molecular machine\\r\\nregenerate ATP from ADP. This flow of hydrogen ions across the membrane through ATP synthase is called\\r\\nchemiosmosis.\\r\\nChemiosmosis (Figure 4.15c) is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during aerobic glucose catabolism.\\r\\nThe result of the reactions is the production of ATP from the energy of the electrons removed from hydrogen atoms.\\r\\nThese atoms were originally part of a glucose molecule. At the end of the electron transport system, the electrons\\r\\nare used to reduce an oxygen molecule to oxygen ions. The extra electrons on the oxygen ions attract hydrogen ions\\r\\n(protons) from the surrounding medium, and water is formed. The electron transport chain and the production of\\r\\nATP through chemiosmosis are collectively called oxidative phosphorylation.\\r\\nATP Yield\\r\\nThe number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies. For example, the number of\\r\\nhydrogen ions that the electron transport chain complexes can pump through the membrane varies between\\r\\nspecies. Another source of variance stems from the shuttle of electrons across the mitochondrial membrane. The\\r\\nNADH generated from glycolysis cannot easily enter mitochondria. Thus, electrons are picked up on the inside of the\\r\\nmitochondria by either NAD+or FAD+. Fewer ATP molecules are generated when FAD+acts as a carrier. NAD+is\\r\\nused as the electron transporter in the liver and FAD+in the brain, so ATP yield depends on the tissue being\\r\\nconsidered.\\r\\nAnother factor that affects the yield of ATP molecules generated from glucose is that intermediate compounds in\\r\\nthese pathways are used for other purposes. Glucose catabolism connects with the pathways that build or break\\r\\ndown all other biochemical compounds in cells, and the result is somewhat messier than the ideal situations\\r\\ndescribed thus far. For example, sugars other than glucose are fed into the glycolytic pathway for energy extraction.\\r\\nOther molecules that would otherwise be used to harvest energy in glycolysis or the citric acid cycle may be\\r\\nremoved to form nucleic acids, amino acids, lipids, or other compounds. Overall, in living systems, these pathways\\r\\nof glucose catabolism extract about 34 percent of the energy contained in glucose.\\r\\nCAREER CONNECTION\\r\\nMitochondrial Disease Physician\\r\\nWhat happens when the critical reactions of cellular respiration do not proceed correctly? Mitochondrial diseases\\r\\nare genetic disorders of metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders can arise from mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial\\r\\nDNA, and they result in the production of less energy than is normal in body cells. Symptoms of mitochondrial\\r\\ndiseases can include muscle weakness, lack of coordination, stroke-like episodes, and loss of vision and hearing.\\r\\nMost affected people are diagnosed in childhood, although there are some adult-onset diseases. Identifying and\\r\\ntreating mitochondrial disorders is a specialized medical field. The educational preparation for this profession\\r\\nrequires a college education, followed by medical school with a specialization in medical genetics. Medical\\r\\ngeneticists can be board certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and go on to become associated with\\r\\nprofessional organizations devoted to the study of mitochondrial disease, such as the Mitochondrial Medicine\\r\\nSociety and the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disease.\\r\\n104               4 • How Cells Obtain Energy\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"ajcNiJjkty8jNhEtALXgpK57+hiV4dSDaxAUSDCLUas=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ajcNiJjkty8jNhEtALXgpK57+hiV4dSDaxAUSDCLUas=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"C20K3KkzX0Dq5uy0I9L0LTmvz+uZ6FKUNtOkmLSSrm4=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\n4.4 Fermentation\\r\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\r\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\r\\n•Discuss the fundamental difference between anaerobic cellular respiration and fermentation\\r\\n•Describe the type of fermentation that readily occurs in animal cells and the conditions that initiate that\\r\\nfermentation\\r\\nIn aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is an oxygen molecule, O2. If aerobic respiration occurs, then ATP\\r\\nwill be produced using the energy of the high-energy electrons carried by NADH or FADH2to the electron transport\\r\\nchain. If aerobic respiration does not occur, NADH must be reoxidized to NAD+for reuse as an electron carrier for\\r\\nglycolysis to continue. How is this done? In some living systems the electron transport chain (ETC) use an organic\\r\\nmolecule as the final electron acceptor. Processes that use an organic molecule to regenerate NAD+from NADH are\\r\\ncollectively referred to asfermentation. In contrast, in some living systems, the electron transport chain (ETC) uses\\r\\nan inorganic molecule (other than oxygen) as a final electron acceptor to regenerate NAD+which is called anaerobic\\r\\n(do not require oxygen) to achieve NAD+regeneration. Both processes allow organisms to convert energy for their\\r\\nuse in the absence of oxygen.\\r\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\r\\nWatch thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/fermentation2)to see fermentation in action.\\r\\nLactic Acid Fermentation\\r\\nThe fermentation method used by animals and some bacteria like those in yogurt is lactic acid fermentation (Figure\\r\\n4.16). This occurs routinely in mammalian red blood cells and in skeletal muscle that has insufficient oxygen supply\\r\\nto allow aerobic respiration to continue (that is, in muscles used to the point of fatigue). In muscles, lactic acid\\r\\nproduced by fermentation must be removed by the blood circulation and brought to the liver for further metabolism.\\r\\nThe chemical reaction of lactic acid fermentation is the following:\\r\\nThe enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction can proceed in either direction, but\\r\\nthe left-to-right reaction is inhibited by acidic conditions. This lactic acid build-up causes muscle stiffness and\\r\\nfatigue. Once the lactic acid has been removed from the muscle and is circulated to the liver, it can be converted\\r\\nback to pyruvic acid and further catabolized for energy.\\r\\n4.4 • Fermentation               105\\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"rTjyDb2dAQnmf66QSfqRoshKmEiP255Y1jFm/mUd+qo=":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"rTjyDb2dAQnmf66QSfqRoshKmEiP255Y1jFm/mUd+qo=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"PYe9WvBJWxLi1ZN8t5DBgcDKmXIIML3niHcsqfOufvM=\",\"text\":\"\\r\\nVISUAL CONNECTION\\r\\nFIGURE 4.16Lactic acid fermentation is common in muscles that have become exhausted by use.\\r\\nTremetol, a metabolic poison found in white snake root plant, prevents the metabolism of lactate.

AboutConcepts of Biology\\r\\nConcepts of Biologyis designed for the single-\\r\\nsemester introduction to biology course for non-\\r\\nscience majors, which for many students is their only\\r\\ncollege-level science course. As such, this course\\r\\nrepresents an important opportunity for students to\\r\\ndevelop the necessary knowledge, tools, and skills to\\r\\nmake informed decisions as they continue with their\\r\\nlives. Rather than being mired down with facts and\\r\\nvocabulary, the typical non-science major student\\r\\nneeds information presented in a way that is easy to\\r\\nread and understand. Even more importantly, the\\r\\ncontent should be meaningful. Students do much\\r\\nbetter when they understand why biology is relevant to\\r\\ntheir everyday lives. For these reasons,Concepts of\\r\\nBiologyis grounded on an evolutionary basis and\\r\\nincludes exciting features that highlight careers in the\\r\\nbiological sciences and everyday applications of the\\r\\nconcepts at hand. We also strive to show the\\r\\ninterconnectedness of topics within this extremely\\r\\nbroad discipline. In order to meet the needs of today’s\\r\\ninstructors and students, we maintain the overall\\r\\norganization and coverage found in most syllabi for this\\r\\ncourse. A strength ofConcepts of Biologyis that\\r\\ninstructors can customize the book, adapting it to the\\r\\napproach that works best in their classroom. Concepts\\r\\nof Biology also includes an innovative art program that\\r\\nincorporates critical thinking and clicker questions to\\r\\nhelp students understand—and apply—key concepts.

Our scope of content was developed\\r\\nafter surveying over a hundred biology professors and\\r\\nlistening to their coverage needs. We provide a\\r\\nthorough treatment of biology’s fundamental concepts\\r\\nwith a scope that is manageable for instructors and\\r\\nstudents alike. •  Unit 1:The Cellular Foundation of Life. Our\\r\\nopening unit introduces students to the sciences,\\r\\nincluding the process of science and the\\r\\nunderlying concepts from the physical sciences\\r\\nthat provide a framework within which learners\\r\\ncomprehend biological processes. Additionally,\\r\\nstudents will gain solid understanding of the\\r\\nstructures, functions, and processes of the most\\r\\nbasic unit of life: the cell. •  Unit 2:Cell Division and Genetics. Our genetics\\r\\nunit takes learners from the foundations of cellular\\r\\nreproduction to the experiments that revealed the\\r\\nbasis of genetics and laws of inheritance. •  Unit 3:Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. Students will learn the intricacies of DNA, protein\\r\\nsynthesis, and gene regulation and current\\r\\napplications of biotechnology and genomics. •  Unit 4:Evolution and the Diversity of Life. The\\r\\ncore concepts of evolution are discussed in this\\r\\nunit with examples illustrating evolutionary\\r\\nprocesses. Additionally, the evolutionary basis of\\r\\nbiology reappears throughout the textbook in\\r\\ngeneral discussion and is reinforced through\\r\\nspecial call-out features highlighting specific\\r\\nevolution-based topics. The diversity of life is\\r\\nexplored with detailed study of various organisms\\r\\nand discussion of emerging phylogenetic\\r\\nrelationships between and among bacteria, protist\\r\\nkingdoms, fungi, plants, and animals. •  Unit 5:Animal Structure and Function. An\\r\\nintroduction to the form and function of the animal\\r\\nbody is followed by chapters on the immune\\r\\nsystem and animal development. This unit touches\\r\\non the biology of all organisms while maintaining\\r\\nan engaging focus on human anatomy and\\r\\nphysiology that helps students connect to the\\r\\ntopics. •  Unit 6:Ecology.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"171f0033-0b56-4ed2-bf71-640d91139ed8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"171f0033-0b56-4ed2-bf71-640d91139ed8\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"OwjuYze+EwSLAhM280JBv2d5JhILbx3MCg130hq/n7k=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"vQSb95222YMa8efvXLDaLMHVRcfEDqPhaLUrTl9YY5A=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"4b1ebe02-dde3-4567-94f0-72f3f2cbc386\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"wPOojhNpOCixRz8p8MkkWZoQY5nYhfC/pGFEYIMugYc=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"95367c09-94b0-4093-9843-53d410f25072\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"J6cjb6VKgdzneHOX33TllzzUlBIWuqzJEFX+KAnhexQ=\"}},\"hash\":\"gpQTLHz1VryrAueCqgIbwySWi+9n1vzRvVusMuXcWQ4=\",\"text\":\"•  Unit 6:Ecology. Ecological concepts are broadly\\r\\ncovered in this unit, with features highlighting\\r\\nlocalized, real-world issues of conservation and\\r\\nbiodiversity. Pedagogical Foundation and Features\\r\\nBecause of the impact science has on students and\\r\\nsociety, an important goal of science education is to\\r\\nachieve a scientifically literate population that\\r\\nconsistently makes informed decisions. Scientific\\r\\nliteracy transcends a basic understanding of scientific\\r\\nprinciples and processes to include the ability to make\\r\\nsense of the myriad instances where people encounter\\r\\nscience in day-to-day life. Thus, a scientifically literate\\r\\nperson is one who uses science content knowledge to\\r\\nmake informed decisions, either personally or socially,\\r\\nabout topics or issues that have a connection with\\r\\nscience. Concepts of Biology is grounded on a solid\\r\\nscientific base and designed to promote scientific\\r\\nliteracy. Throughout the text, you will find features that\\r\\nengage the students in scientific inquiry by taking\\r\\nselected topics a step further. •Evolution Connectionfeatures uphold the\\r\\nimportance of evolution to all biological study\\r\\nthrough discussions like “Global Decline of Coral\\r\\nReefs” and “The Red Queen Hypothesis. ”\\r\\n•Career Connectionfeatures present information\\r\\non a variety of careers in the biological sciences,\\r\\nintroducing students to the educational\\r\\nrequirements and day-to-day work life of a variety\\r\\nof professions, such as forensic scientists,\\r\\nregistered dietitians, and biogeographers. •Everyday Connectionfeatures tie biological\\r\\nconcepts to emerging issues and discuss science\\r\\nin terms of everyday life.

From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with four questions: What are the shared\\r\\nproperties that make something “alive”? How do those various living things function? When faced\\r\\nwith the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that\\r\\nwe can better understand them? And, finally—what biologists ultimately seek to understand—how\\r\\ndid this diversity arise and how is it continuing? As new organisms are discovered every day,\\r\\nbiologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions. Properties of Life\\r\\nAll groups of living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or\\r\\nresponse to stimuli, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation/homeostasis,\\r\\nenergy processing, and evolution. When viewed together, these eight characteristics serve to\\r\\ndefine life. Order\\r\\nOrganisms are highly organized structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple,\\r\\nsingle-celled organisms are remarkably complex. Inside each cell, atoms make up molecules. These in turn make up cell components or organelles. Multicellular organisms, which may consist\\r\\nof millions of individual cells, have an advantage over single-celled organisms in that their cells\\r\\ncan be specialized to perform specific functions, and even sacrificed in certain situations for the\\r\\ngood of the organism as a whole. How these specialized cells come together to form organs such\\r\\nas the heart, lung, or skin in organisms like the toad shown inFigure 1.2will be discussed later. FIGURE 1.2A toad represents a highly organized structure consisting of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.(credit: \\\"Ivengo(RUS)\\\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\r\\nSensitivity or Response to Stimuli\\r\\nOrganisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light or\\r\\nrespond to touch (Figure 1.3). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a\\r\\nprocess called chemotaxis) or light (phototaxis). Movement toward a stimulus is considered a\\r\\npositive response, while movement away from a stimulus is considered a negative response. 6               1 • Introduction to Biology\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e696ee84-aae9-44d6-8800-12b006f47d5b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e696ee84-aae9-44d6-8800-12b006f47d5b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"hxfQrBsLZ/iIWFRg1MGTsddm+ATtGgsqpG0AgB9Yg3Q=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"MDEoRzgWwE6YIPvte6X7Z3hSUjzswLvcCWD0x/rUcFI=\"}},\"hash\":\"mbmoeV0hjPhquFUzP1U5Y1F7BdPLaTq0Z6GjxGn2rGs=\",\"text\":\"FIGURE 1.3The leaves of this sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched.

Reproduction\\r\\nSingle-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, which is the genetic material, and then dividing it\\r\\nequally as the cell prepares to divide to form two new cells. Many multicellular organisms (those made up of more\\r\\nthan one cell) produce specialized reproductive cells that will form new individuals. When reproduction occurs, DNA\\r\\ncontaining genes is passed along to an organism’s offspring. These genes are the reason that the offspring will\\r\\nbelong to the same species and will have characteristics similar to the parent, such as fur color and blood type. Adaptation\\r\\nAll living organisms exhibit a “fit” to their environment. Biologists refer to this fit as adaptation and it is a\\r\\nconsequence of evolution by natural selection, which operates in every lineage of reproducing organisms. Examples\\r\\nof adaptations are diverse and unique, from heat-resistant Archaea that live in boiling hot springs to the tongue\\r\\nlength of a nectar-feeding moth that matches the size of the flower from which it feeds. Adaptations enhance the\\r\\nreproductive potential of the individual exhibiting them, including their ability to survive to reproduce. Adaptations\\r\\nare not constant. As an environment changes, natural selection causes the characteristics of the individuals in a\\r\\npopulation to track those changes. Growth and Development\\r\\nOrganisms grow and develop according to specific instructions coded for by their genes. These genes provide\\r\\ninstructions that will direct cellular growth and development, ensuring that a species’ young (Figure 1.4) will grow\\r\\nup to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its parents. 1.1 • Themes and Concepts of Biology               7\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e82dfc0c-b056-49ef-8591-138c23366319":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e82dfc0c-b056-49ef-8591-138c23366319\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"WoMW4ZCiE7EuZRE2DnxMuAMuqgHpoRZdOvbZcZnkIbs=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5Gddsx2Q/RCdrmFb54kMtTvn9VTJDkfHUrxiRqAdw3U=\"}},\"hash\":\"m/2rooSlWbcsDUF8EUz4Wy7SVSQ6vUakg1FPQ1qnLTg=\",\"text\":\"FIGURE 1.4Although no two look alike, these kittens have inherited genes from both parents and share many of the same characteristics.(credit: Pieter & Renée Lanser)\\r\\nRegulation/Homeostasis\\r\\nEven the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal\\r\\nfunctions, such as the transport of nutrients, response to stimuli, and coping with environmental stresses. Homeostasis(literally, “steady state”) refers to the relatively stable internal environment required to maintain life. For example, organ systems such as the digestive or circulatory systems perform specific functions like carrying\\r\\noxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body. To function properly, cells require appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and concentrations of\\r\\ndiverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms are able to\\r\\nmaintain homeostatic internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes,\\r\\nby activation of regulatory mechanisms. For example, many organisms regulate their body temperature in a process\\r\\nknown as thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (Figure 1.5), have body\\r\\nstructures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. In hot climates, organisms have\\r\\nmethods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat.

Biotechnologists apply the knowledge of biology to create useful products. Ecologists study the interactions of organisms in their environments.

Bioethics is an important and continually evolving field, in which\\r\\nresearchers collaborate with other thinkers and organizations. They work to define guidelines for current practice,\\r\\nand also continually consider new developments and emerging technologies in order to form answers for the years\\r\\nand decades to come. Unfortunately, the emergence of bioethics as a field came after a number of clearly unethical practices, where\\r\\nbiologists did not treat research subjects with dignity and in some cases did them harm. In the 1932 Tuskegee\\r\\nsyphilis study, 399 African American men were diagnosed with syphilis but were never informed that they had the\\r\\ndisease, leaving them to live with and pass on the illness to others. Doctors even withheld proven medications\\r\\nbecause the goal of the study was to understand the impact of untreated syphilis on Black men. While the decisions made in the Tuskegee study are unjustifiable, some decisions are genuinely difficult to make. For example, bioethicists may examine the implications of gene editing technologies, including the ability to create\\r\\norganisms that may displace others in the environment, as well as the ability to “design” human beings. In that\\r\\neffort, ethicists will likely seek to balance the positive outcomes -- such as improved therapies or prevention of\\r\\ncertain illnesses -- with negative outcomes. Bioethics are not simple, and often leave scientists balancing benefits with harm. In this text and course, you will\\r\\ndiscuss medical discoveries that, at their core, have what many consider an ethical lapse.

Unique\\r\\ncharacteristics of her illnesses gave her cells the ability to divide continuously, essentially making them “immortal. ”\\r\\nWithout her knowledge or permission, researchers took samples of her cells and with them created the immortal\\r\\nHeLa cell line.

Inductive reasoningis a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion. This type of reasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and\\r\\nrecords them. These data can be qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (consisting of numbers), and the raw data\\r\\ncan be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many observations, the scientist can infer\\r\\nconclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from\\r\\ncareful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain studies often work this way. Many brains are\\r\\nobserved while people are doing a task. The part of the brain that lights up, indicating activity, is then demonstrated\\r\\nto be the part controlling the response to that task. Deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reasoning, the\\r\\npattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning.Deductive reasoningis a\\r\\nform of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to predict specific results. From those general principles,\\r\\na scientist can deduce and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. For example, a prediction would be that if the climate is becoming warmer in a region, the distribution of plants and\\r\\nanimals should change. Comparisons have been made between distributions in the past and the present, and the\\r\\nmany changes that have been found are consistent with a warming climate. Finding the change in distribution is\\r\\nevidence that the climate change conclusion is a valid one. Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and\\r\\nhypothesis-based science.Descriptive(or discovery)scienceaims to observe, explore, and discover, while\\r\\nhypothesis-based sciencebegins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be\\r\\ntested. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, because most scientific endeavors\\r\\ncombine both approaches. Observations lead to questions, questions lead to forming a hypothesis as a possible\\r\\nanswer to those questions, and then the hypothesis is tested.

Let’s think about a simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the\\r\\nproblem. One Monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That\\r\\nis an observation that also describes a problem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: “Why\\r\\nis the classroom so warm? ”\\r\\nRecall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested. To solve a problem, several hypotheses may\\r\\nbe proposed. For example, one hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because no one turned on the air\\r\\nconditioning. ” But there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be\\r\\nproposed. A second hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air\\r\\nconditioning doesn’t work. ”\\r\\nOnce a hypothesis has been selected, a prediction may be made. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it\\r\\ntypically has the format “If . . . then . . . . ” For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, “Ifthe\\r\\nstudent turns on the air conditioning,thenthe classroom will no longer be too warm. ”\\r\\nA hypothesis must be testable to ensure that it is valid. For example, a hypothesis that depends on what a bear\\r\\nthinks is not testable, because it can never be known what a bear thinks. It should also befalsifiable, meaning that\\r\\nit can be disproven by experimental results. An example of an unfalsifiable hypothesis is “Botticelli’sBirth of Venus\\r\\nis beautiful. ” There is no experiment that might show this statement to be false. To test a hypothesis, a researcher\\r\\nwill conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. This is important.

If an experiment fails to disprove a hypothesis, then we find support for that explanation, but this is\\r\\nnot to say that down the road a better explanation will not be found, or a more carefully designed experiment will be\\r\\nfound to falsify the hypothesis. Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls. Avariableis any part of the experiment\\r\\nthat can vary or change during the experiment. Acontrolis a part of the experiment that does not change. Look for\\r\\nthe variables and controls in the example that follows. As a simple example, an experiment might be conducted to\\r\\ntest the hypothesis that phosphate limits the growth of algae in freshwater ponds. A series of artificial ponds are\\r\\nfilled with water and half of them are treated by adding phosphate each week, while the other half are treated by\\r\\nadding a salt that is known not to be used by algae. The variable here is the phosphate (or lack of phosphate), the\\r\\nexperimental or treatment cases are the ponds with added phosphate and the control ponds are those with\\r\\nsomething inert added, such as the salt. Just adding something is also a control against the possibility that adding\\r\\nextra matter to the pond has an effect. If the treated ponds show lesser growth of algae, then we have found\\r\\nsupport for our hypothesis. If they do not, then we reject our hypothesis. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis\\r\\ndoes not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates one hypothesis that\\r\\nis not valid (Figure 1.18). Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data\\r\\nare rejected. In recent years a new approach of testing hypotheses has developed as a result of an exponential growth of data\\r\\ndeposited in various databases. Using computer algorithms and statistical analyses of data in databases, a new field\\r\\nof so-called \\\"data research\\\" (also referred to as \\\"in silico\\\" research) provides new methods of data analyses and\\r\\ntheir interpretation.

This question focuses on the differences\\r\\nbetween two types of science: basic science and applied science. Basic scienceor “pure” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that\\r\\nknowledge. It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The\\r\\nimmediate goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledge’s sake, though this does not mean that in the end it\\r\\nmay not result in an application. In contrast,applied scienceor “technology,” aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible,\\r\\nfor example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural\\r\\ndisaster. In applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher. Some individuals may perceive applied science as “useful” and basic science as “useless. ” A question these people\\r\\nmight pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, “What for? ” A careful look at the history of\\r\\nscience, however, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. Many\\r\\nscientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before an application is developed; therefore,\\r\\napplied science relies on the results generated through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move\\r\\non from basic science and instead to find solutions to actual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that\\r\\nthere are problems that demand immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of\\r\\nthe knowledge generated through basic science. One example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the\\r\\ndiscovery of DNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication. Strands of DNA, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life. During DNA replication, new copies of DNA are made, shortly before a cell divides to form new cells. Understanding\\r\\nthe mechanisms of DNA replication enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to\\r\\nidentify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine paternity.

Science has many fields; those fields related to\\r\\nthe physical world and its phenomena are considered\\r\\nnatural sciences. A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for an\\r\\nobservation. A generally accepted scientific theory is\\r\\nthoroughly tested and confirmed explanation for a set\\r\\nof observations or phenomena. A scientific law is a\\r\\ndescription, often in the form of a mathematical\\r\\nformula, of the behavior of an aspect of nature under\\r\\ncertain circumstances.

Deductive\\r\\nreasoning is a form of logical thinking that predicts\\r\\nresults by applying general principles. The common\\r\\nthread throughout scientific research is the use of the\\r\\nscientific method. Scientists present their results in\\r\\npeer-reviewed scientific papers published in scientific\\r\\njournals. Science can be basic or applied. The main goal of basic\\r\\nscience is to expand knowledge without any\\r\\nexpectation of short-term practical application of that\\r\\nknowledge.

All\\r\\nmatter is composed ofelements, substances that cannot be broken down or transformed\\r\\nchemically into other substances. Each element is made of atoms, each with a constant number of\\r\\nprotons and unique properties. A total of 118 elements have been defined; however, only 92 occur\\r\\nnaturally, and fewer than 30 are found in living cells. The remaining 26 elements are unstable and,\\r\\ntherefore, do not exist for very long or are theoretical and have yet to be detected. Each element is designated by its chemical symbol (such as H, N, O, C, and Na), and possesses\\r\\nunique properties. These unique properties allow elements to combine and to bond with each\\r\\nother in specific ways. Atoms\\r\\nAn atom is the smallest component of an element that retains all of the chemical properties of\\r\\nthat element. For example, one hydrogen atom has all of the properties of the element hydrogen,\\r\\nsuch as it exists as a gas at room temperature, and it bonds with oxygen to create a water\\r\\nmolecule. Hydrogen atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the\\r\\nproperties of hydrogen. If a hydrogen atom were broken down into subatomic particles, it would\\r\\nno longer have the properties of hydrogen. At the most basic level, all organisms are made of a combination of elements. They contain atoms\\r\\nthat combine together to form molecules. In multicellular organisms, such as animals, molecules\\r\\ncan interact to form cells that combine to form tissues, which make up organs. These\\r\\ncombinations continue until entire multicellular organisms are formed. All atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons (Figure 2.2).

The number of electrons does not factor into the overall mass, because their mass is so\\r\\nsmall. As stated earlier, each element has its own unique properties. Each contains a different number of protons and\\r\\nneutrons, giving it its own atomic number and mass number. Theatomic numberof an element is equal to the\\r\\nnumber of protons that element contains. Themass number, or atomic mass, is the number of protons plus the\\r\\nnumber of neutrons of that element. Therefore, it is possible to determine the number of neutrons by subtracting\\r\\nthe atomic number from the mass number. These numbers provide information about the elements and how they will react when combined. Different elements\\r\\nhave different melting and boiling points, and are in different states (liquid, solid, or gas) at room temperature. They\\r\\nalso combine in different ways. Some form specific types of bonds, whereas others do not. How they combine is\\r\\nbased on the number of electrons present. Because of these characteristics, the elements are arranged into the\\r\\nperiodic table of elements, a chart of the elements that includes the atomic number and relative atomic mass of\\r\\neach element. The periodic table also provides key information about the properties of elements (Figure 2.2)—often\\r\\nindicated by color-coding.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION\\r\\nCarbon Dating\\r\\nCarbon-14 (14C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. This is a\\r\\ncontinuous process, so more14C is always being created. As a living organism develops, the relative level of14C in\\r\\nits body is equal to the concentration of14C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting14C,\\r\\nso the ratio will decline.14C decays to14N by a process called beta decay; it gives off energy in this slow process. After approximately 5,730 years, only one-half of the starting concentration of14C will have been converted to14N. The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay to its more stable form is called its half-\\r\\nlife. Because the half-life of14C is long, it is used to age formerly living objects, such as fossils. Using the ratio of the\\r\\n14C concentration found in an object to the amount of14C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope\\r\\nthat has not yet decayed can be determined.

Chemical Bonds\\r\\nHow elements interact with one another depends on how their electrons are arranged and how many openings for\\r\\nelectrons exist at the outermost region where electrons are present in an atom. Electrons exist at energy levels that\\r\\nform shells around the nucleus. The closest shell can hold up to two electrons. The closest shell to the nucleus is\\r\\nalways filled first, before any other shell can be filled. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot\\r\\noccupied within the lowest shell. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the lowest shell with its\\r\\ntwo electrons. If you look at the periodic table, you will see that hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in\\r\\nthe first row. This is because they only have electrons in their first shell. Hydrogen and helium are the only two\\r\\nelements that have the lowest shell and no other shells. The second and third energy levels can hold up to eight electrons. The eight electrons are arranged in four pairs and\\r\\none position in each pair is filled with an electron before any pairs are completed. Looking at the periodic table again (Figure 2.3), you will notice that there are seven rows. These rows correspond to\\r\\nthe number of shells that the elements within that row have. The elements within a particular row have increasing\\r\\nnumbers of electrons as the columns proceed from left to right. Although each element has the same number of\\r\\nshells, not all of the shells are completely filled with electrons. If you look at the second row of the periodic table,\\r\\nyou will find lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and neon (Ne).

The shared electrons spend\\r\\nmore time associated with the oxygen atom than they do with hydrogen atoms.

When a substance readily forms hydrogen bonds with water, it can dissolve in water and is referred\\r\\nto ashydrophilic(“water-loving”). Hydrogen bonds are not readily formed with nonpolar substances like oils and\\r\\nfats (Figure 2.8). These nonpolar compounds arehydrophobic(“water-fearing”) and will not dissolve in water.

(credit: Gautam Dogra)\\r\\nWater Stabilizes Temperature\\r\\nThe hydrogen bonds in water allow it to absorb and release heat energy more slowly than many other substances. Temperatureis a measure of the motion (kinetic energy) of molecules. As the motion increases, energy is higher\\r\\nand thus temperature is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature rises. Increased energy\\r\\ndisrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules.

In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship program and\\r\\npass a national exam.

Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are\\r\\nfibrous in nature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is critical to its function. Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to\\r\\npermanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to a loss of function ordenaturation(to be discussed in\\r\\nmore detail later). All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 kinds of amino acids. Amino acidsare the monomers that make up proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which\\r\\nconsists of a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group (–NH2), a carboxyl group (–COOH), and a hydrogen\\r\\natom. Every amino acid also has another variable atom or group of atoms bonded to the central carbon atom known\\r\\nas the R group. The R group is the only difference in structure between the 20 amino acids; otherwise, the amino\\r\\nacids are identical (Figure 2.20). FIGURE 2.20Amino acids are made up of a central carbon bonded to an amino group (–NH2), a carboxyl group (–COOH), and a hydrogenatom. The central carbon’s fourth bond varies among the different amino acids, as seen in these examples of alanine, valine, lysine, and\\r\\naspartic acid.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION\\r\\nThe Evolutionary Significance of Cytochrome c\\r\\nCytochrome c is an important component of the molecular machinery that harvests energy from glucose. Because\\r\\nthis protein’s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years. Protein\\r\\nsequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of sequence similarity among cytochrome c molecules of\\r\\ndifferent species; evolutionary relationships can be assessed by measuring the similarities or differences among\\r\\nvarious species’ protein sequences. For example, scientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino acids. For each cytochrome\\r\\nc molecule that has been sequenced to date from different organisms, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same\\r\\nposition in each cytochrome c. This indicates that all of these organisms are descended from a common ancestor. On comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences, no sequence difference was found. When human and\\r\\nrhesus monkey sequences were compared, a single difference was found in one amino acid. In contrast, human-to-\\r\\nyeast comparisons show a difference in 44 amino acids, suggesting that humans and chimpanzees have a more\\r\\nrecent common ancestor than humans and the rhesus monkey, or humans and yeast. Protein Structure\\r\\nAs discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function. To understand how the protein gets its final\\r\\nshape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and\\r\\nquaternary (Figure 2.21). The unique sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. The unique\\r\\nsequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene that encodes the protein. Any change in the gene\\r\\nsequence may lead to a different amino acid being added to the polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein\\r\\nstructure and function. William Warrick Cardozo showed that sickle-cell anemia is caused by a change in protein\\r\\nstrucure as a result of gene encoding, meaning that it is an inherited disorder.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6f1b7f0c-d5b1-402a-bcea-d0ab12678ab1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6f1b7f0c-d5b1-402a-bcea-d0ab12678ab1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"M1wbM/24Saxhr9sPWpCHFB0Uxlg4QPzD1UIJGSRyQfs=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"iwfnAE0OBuguH/rIMWDYVFPU7ILhfHQyWO3QaKdsrvo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"febd989a-2e1e-408a-8dda-4697ad805197\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"aqVa2DZiNj1RtN68Qc1tgTT41LFpK7SwOt7S8VW34S4=\"}},\"hash\":\"RTCz7/GY7ugn7zCMY8CzJ9yAzP/9XZU1gOVPD5YxPTs=\",\"text\":\"In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin\\r\\nβ chain has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in both the structure and function of the protein. What is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta\\r\\nchains that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The\\r\\nstructural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule—that dramatically\\r\\ndecreases life expectancy in the affected individuals—is a single amino acid of the 600. Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, the normally biconcave, or disc-shaped, red blood cells\\r\\nassume a crescent or “sickle” shape, which clogs arteries. This can lead to a myriad of serious health problems,\\r\\nsuch as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for those who have this disease. Folding patterns resulting from interactions between the non-R group portions of amino acids give rise to the\\r\\nsecondary structure of the protein. The most common are the alpha (α)-helix and beta (β)-pleated sheet structures. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds. In the alpha helix, the bonds form between every fourth\\r\\namino acid and cause a twist in the amino acid chain. In the β-pleated sheet, the “pleats” are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of the\\r\\npolypeptide chain. The R groups are attached to the carbons, and extend above and below the folds of the pleat. The\\r\\npleated segments align parallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the same pairs of atoms on each\\r\\nof the aligned amino acids.

For\\r\\nexample, epithelial cells protect the surface of the body and cover the organs and body cavities\\r\\nwithin. Bone cells help to support and protect the body.

Several systems functioning together form an organism (such as an elephant, for\\r\\nexample). There are many types of cells, and all are grouped into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic\\r\\nand eukaryotic. Animal cells, plant cells, fungal cells, and protist cells are classified as eukaryotic,\\r\\nwhereas bacteria and archaea cells are classified as prokaryotic. Before discussing the criteria for\\r\\ndetermining whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic, let us first examine how biologists study\\r\\ncells. Microscopy\\r\\nCells vary in size. With few exceptions, individual cells are too small to be seen with the naked eye,\\r\\nso scientists use microscopes to study them. Amicroscopeis an instrument that magnifies an\\r\\nobject. Most images of cells are taken with a microscope and are called micrographs. Light Microscopes\\r\\nTo give you a sense of the size of a cell, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a\\r\\nmeter or eight micrometers (abbreviated as μm) in diameter; the head of a pin is about two\\r\\nthousandths of a meter (millimeters, or mm) in diameter. That means that approximately 250 red\\r\\nblood cells could fit on the head of a pin. The optics of the lenses of a light microscope changes the orientation of the image. A specimen\\r\\nthat is right-side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing\\r\\nleft when viewed through a microscope, and vice versa. Similarly, if the slide is moved left while\\r\\nlooking through the microscope, it will appear to move right, and if moved down, it will seem to\\r\\nmove up. This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a3fd9c4b-d54b-4565-948b-f213868984f9":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a3fd9c4b-d54b-4565-948b-f213868984f9\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"dn8YZNLV/rHyLoPu0Q/V9KKCp3IfpqlXuIq2my4ii04=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"DwmEla4GpvC0DVeXsDx55piI5ym0qx+HrdKi0eMGOP0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"013f9c4d-6afd-4cbb-8bec-bcc93af09726\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"KsDM0x1dM+h+uVYoqH/4UccjEykkZ5KOhvVX5Qd5utM=\"}},\"hash\":\"AJqz/IStmFJGFQipRu7E1g8jfsQ4pFbBsInaZBoXKIA=\",\"text\":\"This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image. Due to\\r\\nthe manner in which light travels through the lenses, this system of lenses produces an inverted\\r\\nimage (binoculars and a dissecting microscope work in a similar manner, but include an additional\\r\\nmagnification system that makes the final image appear to be upright). Most student microscopes are classified as light microscopes (Figure 3.2a). Visible light both\\r\\npasses through and is bent by the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light\\r\\nmicroscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but since individual cells are generally\\r\\ntransparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special stains. Staining, however, usually kills the cells. Light microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to\\r\\napproximately 400 times. Two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and\\r\\nresolving power. Magnification is the degree of enlargement of an object. Resolving power is the\\r\\nability of a microscope to allow the eye to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate; the\\r\\nhigher the resolution, the closer those two objects can be, and the better the clarity and detail of\\r\\nthe image. When oil immersion lenses are used, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times\\r\\nfor the study of smaller cells, like most prokaryotic cells. Because light entering a specimen from\\r\\nbelow is focused onto the eye of an observer, the specimen can be viewed using light microscopy. For this reason, for light to pass through a specimen, the sample must be thin or translucent.

Thick objects can be examined with many\\r\\ncomponents in focus at the same time. These microscopes are designed to give a magnified and clear view of tissue\\r\\nstructure as well as the anatomy of the whole organism. Like light microscopes, most modern dissecting\\r\\nmicroscopes are also binocular, meaning that they have two separate lens systems, one for each eye. The lens\\r\\nsystems are separated by a certain distance, and therefore provide a sense of depth in the view of their subject to\\r\\nmake manipulations by hand easier. Dissecting microscopes also have optics that correct the image so that it\\r\\nappears as if being seen by the naked eye and not as an inverted image. The light illuminating a sample under a\\r\\ndissecting microscope typically comes from above the sample, but may also be directed from below. FIGURE 3.2(a) Most light microscopes used in a college biology lab can magnify cells up to approximately 400 times. (b) Dissectingmicroscopes have a lower magnification than light microscopes and are used to examine larger objects, such as tissues. Electron Microscopes\\r\\nIn contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light. Not only\\r\\ndoes this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail (Figure 3.3), it also provides higher resolving power. Preparation of a specimen for viewing under an electron microscope will kill it; therefore, live cells cannot be viewed\\r\\nusing this type of microscopy. In addition, the electron beam moves best in a vacuum, making it impossible to view\\r\\nliving materials. In a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell’s surface, rendering the\\r\\ndetails of cell surface characteristics by reflection. Cells and other structures are usually coated with a metal like\\r\\ngold. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam is transmitted through the cell and provides details\\r\\nof a cell’s internal structures. As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and\\r\\nexpensive than are light microscopes. 3.1 • How Cells Are Studied               57\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"058f1560-5e05-4d7f-9f67-3a84b1322e09":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"058f1560-5e05-4d7f-9f67-3a84b1322e09\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"hL+VqO+xF+23WiNjT9Ma/cUc3dgnWuF0Iy5bc6ipL1o=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"9gQ192o7Z93tzc6YmJckEJTe3KZ9qrrPmFk9mE8pm58=\"}},\"hash\":\"RNXE4zQY7A8WjCGcDmbb2oJT1RhhcHMo1g/YWQZlZgc=\",\"text\":\"FIGURE 3.3(a)Salmonellabacteria are viewed with a light microscope.

Cytotechnologists (cyto- = cell) are professionals who study cells through microscopic examinations and other\\r\\nlaboratory tests. They are trained to determine which cellular changes are within normal limits or are abnormal. Their focus is not limited to cervical cells; they study cellular specimens that come from all organs. When they notice\\r\\nabnormalities, they consult a pathologist, who is a medical doctor who can make a clinical diagnosis. Cytotechnologists play vital roles in saving people’s lives. When abnormalities are discovered early, a patient’s\\r\\ntreatment can begin sooner, which usually increases the chances of successful treatment. 58               3 • Cell Structure and Function\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6734926c-e2eb-4aab-a7a5-fa62154d1589":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6734926c-e2eb-4aab-a7a5-fa62154d1589\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"lwBijmfjlrlmPjpf/WVGigly6BuMryvaMKyrutXSUqU=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"PqoaiVA6ucrzi1oj/midbdVftBlyouX6Unv17eT8mV8=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"168855e2-5e56-427b-8a5b-021c72354f1c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"hSrmuBJz1yGCUn2nAaFyGSnxlGicHurRfvepykSQzT8=\"}},\"hash\":\"lK0n1IkZcFqERC2UEpi197U3Hb5dqZRDSFFodvNK8ZI=\",\"text\":\"FIGURE 3.4These uterine cervix cells, viewed through a light microscope, were obtained from a Pap smear.

In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa. Later advances in lenses and microscope\\r\\nconstruction enabled other scientists to see different components inside cells. By the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed\\r\\ntheunified cell theory, which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells, that the cell is the\\r\\nbasic unit of life, and that all new cells arise from existing cells.

The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps\\r\\nthe cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its\\r\\nenvironment.

Aeukaryotic cellis a cell that has a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound compartments or sacs,\\r\\ncalledorganelles, which have specialized functions.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION\\r\\nEndosymbiosis\\r\\nWe have mentioned that both mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA and ribosomes. Have you wondered why? Strong evidence points to endosymbiosis as the explanation. Symbiosis is a relationship in which organisms from two separate species live in close association and typically\\r\\nexhibit specific adaptations to each other. Endosymbiosis (endo-= within) is a relationship in which one organism\\r\\nlives inside the other. Endosymbiotic relationships abound in nature. Microbes that produce vitamin K live inside the\\r\\nhuman gut. This relationship is beneficial for us because we are unable to synthesize vitamin K. It is also beneficial\\r\\nfor the microbes because they are protected from other organisms and are provided a stable habitat and abundant\\r\\nfood by living within the large intestine. Scientists have long noticed that bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are similar in size and have other similar\\r\\nfeatures. In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists discovered that mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA and\\r\\nribosomes, just as bacteria do. In 1967, Lynn Margulis used microbial evidence in her proposal of endosymbiotic\\r\\ntheory, which indicated that these organelles originated from separate organisms. Although Margulis’s work was\\r\\nmet with resistance, this basic component of this once-revolutionary hypothesis is now widely accepted. Scientists\\r\\nbelieve that host cells and bacteria formed a mutually beneficial endosymbiotic relationship when the host cells\\r\\ningested aerobic bacteria and cyanobacteria but did not destroy them. Through evolution, these ingested bacteria\\r\\nbecame more specialized in their functions, with the aerobic bacteria becoming mitochondria and the\\r\\nphotosynthetic bacteria becoming chloroplasts.

Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in controlled quantities. Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly\\r\\nin flux. The plasma membrane must be sufficiently flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white\\r\\nblood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more obvious functions of a\\r\\nplasma membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize\\r\\none another, which is vital as tissues and organs form during early development, and which later plays a role in the\\r\\n“self” versus “non-self” distinction of the immune response. The plasma membrane also carries receptors, which are attachment sites for specific substances that interact with\\r\\nthe cell. Each receptor is structured to bind with a specific substance. For example, surface receptors of the\\r\\nmembrane create changes in the interior, such as changes in enzymes of metabolic pathways. These metabolic\\r\\npathways might be vital for providing the cell with energy, making specific substances for the cell, or breaking down\\r\\ncellular waste or toxins for disposal.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"fe778e12-01af-40ee-aedf-e8daaeb9b359":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"fe778e12-01af-40ee-aedf-e8daaeb9b359\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"JsHiY9isWkuN7MYzj9zQ8JGeA3IMkMD3kRLTTkEyRQY=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"vAtqIFsqLc19Advjfs7o3A6dt3ieCBwuDq3AuGhsei0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"59821814-c74a-4392-a700-fffe45bc3de4\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"gb/1kbhZZuKw8l9Q8LMNBcC0Bj6tB33JKloKFVZDo00=\"}},\"hash\":\"YlEsE3PggvKLVAR0ySyMeIFKoRf8YjTXLOhgp9v9LBU=\",\"text\":\"Receptors on the plasma membrane’s exterior surface interact with hormones\\r\\nor neurotransmitters, and allow their messages to be transmitted into the cell.

The fluid mosaic model describes\\r\\nthe structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components—including phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins,\\r\\nand carbohydrates—in which the components are able to flow and change position, while maintaining the basic\\r\\nintegrity of the membrane. Both phospholipid molecules and embedded proteins are able to diffuse rapidly and\\r\\nlaterally in the membrane.

As a comparison,\\r\\nhuman red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 μm thick, or approximately 1,000 times\\r\\nthicker than a plasma membrane. (Figure 3.18)\\r\\nFIGURE 3.18The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane structure describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination ofphospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates. The plasma membrane is made up primarily of a bilayer of phospholipids with embedded proteins, carbohydrates,\\r\\nglycolipids, and glycoproteins, and, in animal cells, cholesterol. The amount of cholesterol in animal plasma\\r\\nmembranes regulates the fluidity of the membrane and changes based on the temperature of the cell’s\\r\\nenvironment. In other words, cholesterol acts as antifreeze in the cell membrane and is more abundant in animals\\r\\nthat live in cold climates. The main fabric of the membrane is composed of two layers of phospholipid molecules, and the polar ends of these\\r\\nmolecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist’s rendition of the model) (Figure 3.18) are in contact with\\r\\naqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell. Thus, both surfaces of the plasma membrane are hydrophilic. In\\r\\ncontrast, the interior of the membrane, between its two surfaces, is a hydrophobic or nonpolar region because of the\\r\\nfatty acid tails.

A large particle,\\r\\nhowever, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell. Electrochemical Gradient\\r\\nWe have discussed simple concentration gradients—differential concentrations of a substance across a space or a\\r\\nmembrane—but in living systems, gradients are more complex. Because cells contain proteins, most of which are\\r\\nnegatively charged, and because ions move into and out of cells, there is an electrical gradient, a difference of\\r\\ncharge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the\\r\\nextracellular fluid in which they are bathed; at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K+)\\r\\nand lower concentrations of sodium (Na+) than does the extracellular fluid. Thus, in a living cell, the concentration\\r\\ngradient and electrical gradient of Na+promotes diffusion of the ion into the cell, and the electrical gradient of Na+\\r\\n(a positive ion) tends to drive it inward to the negatively charged interior. The situation is more complex, however, for\\r\\nother elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of K+promotes diffusion of the ionintothe cell, but the\\r\\nconcentration gradient of K+promotes diffusionoutof the cell (Figure 3.24). The combined gradient that affects an\\r\\nion is called itselectrochemical gradient, and it is especially important to muscle and nerve cells. FIGURE 3.24Electrochemical gradients arise from the combined effects of concentration gradients and electrical gradients. Na+ions are athigher concentration outside the cell, and K+ions are at higher concentration inside of the cell, and yet the inside of the cell has negative\\r\\nnet charge compared to the other side of the membrane. This is due to the presence of K+binding proteins and other negatively chargedmolecules. The difference in electrical charges attracts the positively charged Na ions toward the inside of the cell, the electrical gradient,\\r\\nwhile the K ions tend to flow through K channels toward the outside of the cell due to the concentration difference, the concentrationgradient.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b4224322-6a5b-49cd-848f-966901fe9fd3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b4224322-6a5b-49cd-848f-966901fe9fd3\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"q5QkEfN6SnMp9Dbtri/TFZrTBJXpMZ5Jol4Smt07kpw=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"kgB0tyNnJyG9o+/JcwmuBe1d3n2EGQQ+oDPsIQcTluk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f46a033e-4fb0-4f19-ae6f-1b064fca65b1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"sIca5ldcwfdXw5xbFTMYW77AEiRhArVrnqD07Ldh7a0=\"}},\"hash\":\"rs0MznM77d6tCnnph88IOFfUmMQ/pt6xLXv25Ojf1qk=\",\"text\":\"(credit: modification of work by “Synaptitude”/Wikimedia Commons)\\r\\nMoving Against a Gradient\\r\\nTo move substances against a concentration or an electrochemical gradient, the cell must use energy.

The plasma membrane is a phospholipid\\r\\nbilayer embedded with proteins. The nucleolus within\\r\\nthe nucleus is the site for ribosome assembly. Ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm or are attached\\r\\nto the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or\\r\\nendoplasmic reticulum. They perform protein\\r\\nsynthesis. Mitochondria perform cellular respiration\\r\\nand produce ATP. Peroxisomes break down fatty acids,\\r\\namino acids, and some toxins.

The centrosome has two bodies, the centrioles, with an\\r\\nunknown role in cell division. Lysosomes are the\\r\\ndigestive organelles of animal cells. Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a central\\r\\nvacuole. The plant cell wall, whose primary component\\r\\nis cellulose, protects the cell, provides structural\\r\\nsupport, and gives shape to the cell. Photosynthesis\\r\\ntakes place in chloroplasts.

The plasma\\r\\nmembrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids,\\r\\nwith their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with\\r\\neach other. The landscape of the membrane is studded\\r\\nwith proteins, some of which span the membrane. Some of these proteins serve to transport materials\\r\\ninto or out of the cell.

The fluid\\r\\nnature of the membrane owes itself to the\\r\\nconfiguration of the fatty acid tails, the presence of\\r\\ncholesterol embedded in the membrane (in animal\\r\\ncells), and the mosaic nature of the proteins and\\r\\nprotein-carbohydrate complexes, which are not firmly\\r\\nfixed in place.

In\\r\\nsolutions of more than one substance, each type of\\r\\nmolecule diffuses according to its own concentration\\r\\ngradient. Many factors can affect the rate of diffusion,\\r\\nincluding concentration gradient, the sizes of the\\r\\nparticles that are diffusing, and the temperature of the\\r\\nsystem. In living systems, diffusion of substances into and out\\r\\nof cells is mediated by the plasma membrane. Some\\r\\nmaterials diffuse readily through the membrane, but\\r\\nothers are hindered, and their passage is only made\\r\\npossible by protein channels and carriers.

However, the\\r\\nsecond law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. All energy transfers and\\r\\ntransformations are never completely efficient. In every energy transfer, some amount of energy is lost in a form that\\r\\nis unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy. Thermodynamically,heat energyis defined as the energy\\r\\ntransferred from one system to another that is not work. For example, when a light bulb is turned on, some of the\\r\\nenergy being converted from electrical energy into light energy is lost as heat energy. Likewise, some energy is lost\\r\\nas heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions. An important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder. The more energy that is lost by a system to\\r\\nits surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system is. Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or\\r\\ndisorder within a system as entropy. High entropy means high disorder and low energy. Molecules and chemical\\r\\nreactions have varying entropy as well. For example, entropy increases as molecules at a high concentration in one\\r\\nplace diffuse and spread out. The second law of thermodynamics says that energy will always be lost as heat in\\r\\nenergy transfers or transformations.

(credit: Deborah Austin)\\r\\nEnzymes are key components of metabolic pathways. Understanding how enzymes work and how they can be\\r\\nregulated are key principles behind the development of many of the pharmaceutical drugs on the market today. Biologists working in this field collaborate with other scientists to design drugs (Figure 4.10). Consider statins for example—statins is the name given to one class of drugs that can reduce cholesterol levels. These compounds are inhibitors of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is the enzyme that synthesizes\\r\\ncholesterol from lipids in the body. By inhibiting this enzyme, the level of cholesterol synthesized in the body can be\\r\\nreduced. Similarly, acetaminophen, popularly marketed under the brand name Tylenol, is an inhibitor of the enzyme\\r\\ncyclooxygenase. While it is used to provide relief from fever and inflammation (pain), its mechanism of action is still\\r\\nnot completely understood. How are drugs discovered? One of the biggest challenges in drug discovery is identifying a drug target. A drug target\\r\\nis a molecule that is literally the target of the drug. In the case of statins, HMG-CoA reductase is the drug target. Drug targets are identified through painstaking research in the laboratory. Identifying the target alone is not enough;\\r\\n98               4 • How Cells Obtain Energy\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"49b4b8b9-c49d-4300-a3ed-c9d029cfe0db":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"49b4b8b9-c49d-4300-a3ed-c9d029cfe0db\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"dlvo3ytU2/N/EoVHpFWvp4Hs0mJtRIlMxM/c4YJdv4I=\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"3JNJWXBjkU9O9ljA82jc1YzePCld+A5JAiY1cVePCuE=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"0e6d5aac-038d-4688-9d5d-836667b36529\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\hashi\\\\Documents\\\\llamaindex apps\\\\rag-new-demo-local\\\\data\\\\ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"ConceptsofBiology-WEB (1)-.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"40TNdoHy0d1VIzeHqfw8HVYDDRVMx0VWa2UG2SOew/k=\"}},\"hash\":\"d2Iax3zCIL6E3+I4yywSiYLSt6wl86yF3gIK8BxU4cg=\",\"text\":\"scientists also need to know how the target acts inside the cell and which reactions go awry in the case of disease.

Humans who consume the milk become ill. Symptoms of this\\r\\ndisease, which include vomiting, abdominal pain, and tremors, become worse after exercise. Why do you think this\\r\\nis the case? Alcohol Fermentation\\r\\nAnother familiar fermentation process is alcohol fermentation (Figure 4.17), which produces ethanol, an alcohol. The alcohol fermentation reaction is the following:\\r\\nFIGURE 4.17The reaction resulting in alcohol fermentation is shown. In the first reaction, a carboxyl group is removed from pyruvic acid, releasing carbon dioxide as a gas. The loss of\\r\\ncarbon dioxide reduces the molecule by one carbon atom, making acetaldehyde. The second reaction removes an\\r\\nelectron from NADH, forming NAD+and producing ethanol from the acetaldehyde, which accepts the electron. The\\r\\nfermentation of pyruvic acid by yeast produces the ethanol found in alcoholic beverages (Figure 4.18).
